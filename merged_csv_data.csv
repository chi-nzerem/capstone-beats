R2LQYVEK3JWJW2,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars Great clear and powerful speaker,LilliesofTruth,5,"The sound quality is absolutely exceptional, delivering rich, clear audio that fills the room effortlessly. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music, catching up on podcasts, or enjoying movie nights, the speaker amplifies every sound with incredible depth and clarity. The design is sleek and modern, making it a stylish addition to my home decor, and it is super portable, allowing me to take it along for outdoor gatherings without any hassle. Setup was a breeze, and the Bluetooth connectivity works flawlessly with my devices. I even got a cute matching accessory holder to carry it like a handbag.

R2TB41OYEQ665X,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply great.,Jake,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my entire ownership of this speaker.Time of writing this review is roughly 8 months after purchase, having used this speaker practically every single day since. This was a replacement for a very well-loved but somewhat lacking B&O (P3?) oval-shaped speaker that inspired of few of my must-have features.My key requirements in purchasing a speaker at this price point were:- Punchy, solid bass, with high accuracy, clear playback throughout most of the volume range- Relatively attractive, understated, simple design with ergonomic and intuitive controls- Easily oriented for high quality playback in a variety of different situations (facing sideways, upwards, at angles)- Long-lasting battery without any obnoxious constant playback interruptions informing you of battery life remainingThis speaker delivers on all of these.The bass is incredibly clear, with no horrible warbling and distortion that‚Äôs very common with dozens of other similar speakers. The audio playback is very crisp and clear, with no noticeable quality losses. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs more than adequate for 95%+ of people. Even at low volumes, the quality is still extremely high. There is a usable, enjoyable sound at every volume level.The design is simple, but handsome. It does not look obnoxious or out of place anywhere. It is just the right size, not too large to pop into a bag, and not too small as to have low-power drivers with poor sound. Very easy to transport. The squared design makes it very stable on most surfaces, but is still rounded enough not to get caught on things. The controls are very easy to understand, even the multi-device Bluetooth cycling and syncing. I have no complaints.The speaker works well for playback in nearly any position, especially when placed on a table or other nice playback surface. It can be placed facing upward, and the speaker enhances playback for all-around sound. When placed horizontally, the same happens for directional playback. Very impressive stability in a wide variety of situations. Some would consider the lack of a lanyard or string to be a downside for this point, but there is massive benefits to keeping this speaker on a surface.The battery life is incredible. Vastly longer than I had really expected for this speaker. With my personal usage (middle volume range, 2-3 uses a day for 30 to 60 minutes at a time), I usually recharge every 1-2 weeks. Not sure what exactly that equates to in real playback time, but I still find it impressive. The speaker will notify you at 20% and 10% battery level, which is exactly what I wanted. Many other speakers will interrupt playback at 75%, 50%, etc. I‚Äôve not experienced any noticeable battery decay during my ownership, but I have only fully depleted and nearly fully recharged the entire time, with no ‚Äúfilling up‚Äù in between.Downsides do exist, but most are inconsequential for me.- The audible indicators that inform you of which device you are connected to can sometimes feel a bit sluggish, especially with long device names.- I feel the price point is still a bit on the high side for the value, but I feel I‚Äôve more than gotten my money‚Äôs worth. I just like a good deal.- Volume occasionally spikes very high in certain scenarios when switching between devices, but is fairly easily turned down after a quick scare.I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone in the market for a speaker at this price point. This is an especially good deal on sale. If you‚Äôre still reading at this point, just get the damn thing on the way.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AHZBIFMKWWZHILYEIYOSP4AIA37Q,True,224,Color: Black
R2Y3WBHYS3U0M4,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars A premium speaker in a sturdy package.,Reviewer MHM 3-5,5,"I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a ‚Äúparty‚Äù speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it‚Äôs good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there‚Äôs even some punch of the bass. It‚Äôs so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. üòÇSo (for now), I‚Äôm obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don‚Äôt want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It‚Äôs made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn‚Äôt have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to‚Ä¶2. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it‚Äôs on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They‚Äôre not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you‚Äôll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The ‚ÄúUsed‚Äù unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone‚Äôs trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled ‚ÄúRefurbished‚Äù. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn‚Äôt miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I‚Äôd like y‚Äôall to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you‚Äôre blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn‚Äôt want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don‚Äôt expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AH5F7QHDE5VKRAMBN43A5WPU4ADQ,True,100,Color: Black
R22BP3UXW8MVME,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars sound quality,Max,5,"I'm absolutely thrilled with this speaker! The color is spot on, and the material feels soft yet is easy to clean. The sound quality is impressively good, which was a wonderful surprise. You can position it on its side for directional sound or lay it flat for excellent, all-around audio clarity. Its size is perfect for placing on a desk, counter, or even packing in your luggage. The audio is clear and crisp, and it's waterproof, making it ideal for use in the shower. Charging is straightforward with a USB-C connection, just like most of my other devices. The buttons are soft yet durable.

R3N5UYTNS8D2V6,B099TJGJ91,"4.0 out of 5 stars Small speaker, big sound, travel friendly",jonathan lopez,4,"Got this lil thing for Prime Day for only $99. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I had low expectations and planned on returning it. After opening it and setting it up, I got to see what the hype was about. Took me a couple hours of listening to figure out if it was a bang for my buck or a waste of money.I currently have the first UE Megaboom that I use daily that I bought back in 2016. It‚Äôs loud, has bass and can fill a room. Sadly, the charge isn‚Äôt exactly reliable so I was looking for something new. The Bose Link Flex definitely has a great quality sound. It will definitely fill a room. I like to use mine in the shower and acoustically in the shower the bass just sounds amazing!! Speaker actually fell off the shelf from the bass and survived the fall.Now, I listen to just about every genre of music. I found it to sound best with Latin music. Vocals are super clear. When it came to rap music (or music with lots of bass) I found it to sound perfectly balanced when the volume was at about 75%. Above that you‚Äôll definitely still get volume but the bass will take a seat back. I‚Äôm used to the UE Megaboom that has 360 sound. While the Bose Link Flex will fill a room, the sound seems more straight forward depending if you want to stand it up or lay it down.Bose App is decent. Doesn‚Äôt really have any equalizer setting on there if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre loooking for.I got this because it is small enough to pack in a carry on and not take up too much space in my bag. Might I add, it‚Äôs almost the same size as my iPhone 14 Pro Max . I can easily carry both in one hand. Easy to say, I‚Äôm going to keep this speaker with me. Now let‚Äôs see if the battery life is legit. I‚Äôll check back in.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AF35A3ETTRWH62AWEWFQ2GO27VJA,True,11,Color: Green

R3TVEXDLBORXWI,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars 5 Million Stars!! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,Caitriona Gillespie,5,"OMG this is the best speaker which is not a huge floor speaker (over 1 foot high) that is part of a massive speaker system. The sound quality is truly impressive for a speaker of any size, & I think that if I bought another one, which I'm seriously considering, it would rival my Kenwood stereo system, which has two floor speakers that are over a foot high each, & the Kenwood amplifier, & the Kenwood 5-CD player. All that stuff is so big that it needs its own cabinet & takes up several feet of floor space. I don't know how the geniuses at Bose have done it, but they have somehow packed all that sound into a speaker less than half the size of a loaf of bread that is also a very appealing shade of lilac that goes with my d√©cor. The Bluetooth connection works perfectly every time, even though I don't have the newest phone out there. I'm so in love with this speaker, the only complaint I have is purely aesthetic & easily fixed- the fabric loop attached to this beautiful lilac speaker is, for some unknown reason, an entirely ridiculous shade of brilliant orange, which clashes hideously with everything. I solved this problem with a dark purple Sharpie marker. That is the only complaint I have. While this speaker comes without any instructions on how to set it up, the set up is so easy, even when you're not a technology person, that I set it up myself with no help in under a minute. I plugged it in, turned it on, turned the volume all the way up- for some idiotic reason, it comes with the volume all the way down- & then turned on the Bluetooth on my phone & had it search for Bluetooth devices. My phone found the speaker very quickly, paired with it without issue, & started playing. One important thing to know is that when you leave the range of the speaker for an extended period of time, like when I leave for work & take my phone with me, the speaker will turn that connection off, so that when I get home & want to use my speaker again, I need to go over to the speaker with my phone & push the power button once. The speaker will say how much battery power is left & that it is now connected to my phone- I don't turn the Bluetooth off on my phone when I leave the house. I recommend turning the speaker all the way up & then controlling the volume through your phone, which is what I do. I think that's the easiest way to do it. One charge of the battery lasts a long time- at least 12 hours, so that part's great as well. Just buy it already, you won't regret it. It'll beat the pants off of all of your other speakers, even if you already have a nice set of Bose speakers.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AGKOCRUHY2FG2ZHWTZRUH5JYIFBA,True,19,Color: Chilled Lilac
R2TT1UU35P8I2W,B099TJGJ91,"4.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly loud, no EQ controls, few caveats",Jacob Teeler,4,"Bought this for work (I run a forklift and JBLs just arent loud enough) and was pleasantly surprised by how loud it gets. Sound quality is fantastic at all volume levels, its durable and holds up pretty well to the elements. The battery does genuinely last a full 8-10 hour shift playing constantly. A few things to note however.There are no EQ controls for it. Sound is well balanced but theres no bass boost, treble, no nada built in.The app is unnecessary once you get it set up with your device, really only need it to check the battery. The speaker will tell you what its battery percentage is if you turn it off and on though.Max volume is entirely dependent on the device its paired to. If i pair it to my PC, max volume is pretty quiet. If i pair it to my buddy's phone it gets pretty loud, but nowhere near as loud as it is paired to my phone.Volume controls are independent from the device and speaker. You can turn your speaker volume to max but your device is the primary control. So if you have the speaker on low volume and your phone all the way to the max, it wont be as loud as both at max, and vice versa. Its very odd.It does not remember the bluetooth volume of the device its paired to, so if you turn it off and use it the next day, it has a habit of being at full blown volume by default. Just be mindful.Other than that, its excellent and no one will be disappointed by it.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AHEGWVGORT2NYKVPVFMFBFDUYI7Q,True,2,Color: Black

The unit misleads you by saying you need to download the app 'Bose connect'. I tried to, but could not get it to download from the App store or from the Bose website. Other Bluetooth speakers connected automatically for me, so this was a hassle. I tried to chat with the Bose help bot, but it was of no help; the lady on the phone at Bose tech support was of no help and disconnected mid-sentence and didn't call me back. I tried to return the item on Amazon, then saw a troubleshooting video. Open your 'systems settings' on your computer and select 'sound'; click the Bose option for speaker 'output'.

So it‚Äôs not surprising that they pack a lot of quality into this little speaker. For one thing, holds a charge a long time! And it announces each time it‚Äôs turned on how much charge is left. No guessing. The sound quality is really decent for the size of the speaker. It can get very, very loud, if that‚Äôs your thing. It has a bass booster that I usually leave on. I appreciate that it is water resistant as I take this into the bathroom, the kitchen, camping, etc. It paired readily with my iPhone.

Charged well when I got it. I can hear it from the other room when I walk away and it's got a nice clear quality to the speaker so far. The charging cord that came with it was quite short but functional. The speaker and instructions are insistent about downloading a useless connection application. Seems like another way to advertise more speakers or to sell user data. It was irritating enough, I almost rated this less because of it.Speaker will not connect to my phone via Bluetooth unless I allow the speaker access to contact information.

I wish the bright white/blue lights were red or could be turned off. It gives off just enough light to be bothersome if you truly need a dark room to sleep. Forget using the app, all it does is connect and you don't really need it to even do that. It wouldn't control anything on this speaker. Lastly, why is it talking? I don't need it to tell me the battery level or that my device is disconnected. I don't need it to speak at all. It's rather annoying bc if you disconnect and don't turn it off, it promptly reminds you. Spooked the hell out of me several times. It gets 4 stars bc audio wise it's absolutely on point as expected.

It‚Äôs not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it‚Äôs waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money ‚Äî many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it‚Äôs worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It‚Äôs worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose ‚ÄúRETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.‚Äù I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers.

It gets pretty loud, but I did expect it to have a bit more, but the speaker is much smaller than I expected. That might just be me. This feels very well constructed and is fairly heavy.

R1L69GMOAWA48D,B09GJVTRNZ,5.0 out of 5 stars No Competition,Nicholas,5,"JBL Flip 6 Bluetooth speaker. I‚Äôve been meaning to do a proper review of this speaker for a while now, but finding the time to do so has been difficult. As I mentioned before in a previous post, JBL‚Äôs Bluetooth speakers are excellent. As someone who prefers a HiFi setup (individual components like a receiver, CD player, turntable, bookshelf speakers, etc.), I have never been a fan of Bluetooth speakers. I prefer the definition, clarify, and instrument separation you find in a good pair of passive bookshelf speakers powered by a clean amplifier or receiver, and that preference has not changed. But being able to easily take your music with you wherever you go does have its benefits. I‚Äôve been through quite a few Bluetooth speakers over the years, mainly Ultimate Ears speakers, and I couldn‚Äôt believe how poor the quality of sound was from those speakers. I pretty much gave up on Bluetooth speakers until I decided to try out the JBL Flip 6. For such a small speaker, I could not believe how powerful and clean the sound was. I‚Äôve since tried out the JBL Charge 5, the JBL Xtreme 3, and even the JBL Boombox 3, and each one of those speakers produces great sound. The JBL Boombox 3 is monstrous, and no one really needs that kind of sound unless you‚Äôre entertaining guests in a small or medium-sized venue. At the end of the day, I will always prefer to unwind with a CD or vinyl record played through my stereo receiver and bookshelf speakers at home, and a Bluetooth speaker will never match the clarity and definition of a great pair of passive bookshelf or tower speakers fed by a high-quality amplifier or receiver, but JBL‚Äôs Bluetooth speakers are a good investment if you want to be able to take your music with you. Again, I recommend the Flip 6, but if you‚Äôre able to spend a little more money I recommend the Charge 5 or Xtreme 3.I photographed my Flip 6 perched on two books for scale and also for the promotion of literacy. You know I can‚Äôt help myself. By the way, both of those books in the photo are superb.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2024",AGZQIVFUCTPC4TGGHIGE3RURP6AA,True,11,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6

RVQGQ3BMVNPPU,B09GJVTRNZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Small yet powerful little speakers that sound great!!!,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I‚Äôm old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands‚Ä¶ I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin‚Äôs- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I‚Äôd like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don‚Äôt overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love too!!!! Update with about a week of playing some music and experimenting. The flip 6 turn on its end with tweeters up will produce the best sound and great sound stage. It does better in the vertical position cause the woofer and tweeter vertically aligned give better sound stage hence the vertical axis. Now pair it with a second and you‚Äôll have killer stereo mode. And the charge 5 to the center and you will love the sound as it acts like a sub reinforcement.,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA,True,7,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6

R29NJME9GM5IVB,B08Z1C8NM9,5.0 out of 5 stars Another EXCELLENT Sonos product,J. Sanchez,5,"I am an owner of two Sonos home speakers: the One and the One SL. These are amazing sounding speakers that are easy to use. While I love these speakers, they are not portable as they must stay plugged into an outlet in order to work. I looked at the Sonos Move but was turned off by the size of the speaker and the high price. Needless to say, when Sonos introduced the Roam, I was intrigued. I got it as a father's day gift and what follows are my thoughts on the new Sonos Roam.SoundMy main concern with the Roam was that I noticed it was rather small and how that would effect the sound quality and loudness of the speaker. I was foolish for thinking this however. Sonos is known for having excellent sounding speakers and they would not jeopardize that reputation by putting out a new product that didn't adhere to their high audio standards. This speaker sounds amazing! Music sounds rich and full of depth. The clarity of the highs is excellent and the bass is surprisingly rich and full. Further to the point, the Sonos app allows you to tailor the sound to your liking, adding more of less treble and/or bass. I cannot overstate how pleased I am with the audio quality of this diminutive speaker.As a secondary point under sound, I was also concerned about how loud the speaker could get. Indoors, this little gem can get plenty loud and fill a large space with amazing sound. Outdoors, the Roam does a better than adequate job of projecting great music. I have taken it in my backyard while doing some yard work and it gets loud enough to hear and enjoy the music. However, I don't think Sonos designed this speaker to pump out the tunes at the pool party or at the beach like the EU Boom 3 or other larger bluetooth speakers. It can function adequately in that role but excels in smaller spaces and in overall sound quality.FunctionalityThe speaker works seamlessly with my other two Sonos speakers via WiFi using the Sonos app. The ability to move the speaker all over the house is a major plus. I can configure the Roam to play alone or with either one or both of my other speakers. I love that versatility. The buttons have some straight forward uses and also are multi-functional, which can take some getting used to. For example, I have issues sometimes with the power button and how long to push it. Five seconds to turn it off, a quick push to put it in sleep mode to save power. Same with the play/pause button: once to pause music, twice to advance to the next song, three times to go back to previous song, press and hold for a second to put the speaker in bluetooth pairing mode, and press and hold and listen for a sound in order to be able to swap your music from the Roam to the closest Sonos speaker or vice versa. It has taken some getting used to initially but I'm getting the hang of it.The battery life is good but I wish it were better. I get about 8 hours of play time per charge. Charging is another small issue. Sonos includes a USB-C (plugs into speaker) to USB-A (plugs into charger) charging cable with the speaker, but they do not include a charging adapter to plug into the wall. Luckily, I have an Apple iPad USB-C to USB-C cable with a large 20w charging adapter that charges the Roam very quickly. I highly recommend the larger charging adapter to greatly reduce charging time. As a side note, the speaker can function fully while being charged.Airplay and bluetooth connectivity are straightforward and work well. I have not had any issues connecting the speaker via bluetooth to my phone, laptop and various other devices around my home.FormThe speaker works in either a horizontal or vertical position with some claiming there is a difference in the sound. That is a matter of preference as I like both positions for different reasons. Horizontally, the speaker is designed to project the sound up and it seems to use the surface the speaker is sitting on to amplify the sound. Vertically it sounds great and it is much easier to access the control buttons on top. Ultimately, I love the design of the Roam because it is small, clean and elegant looking.In my opinion, the Sonos Roam is an excellent speaker because of its portability, convenience of use within my existing Sonos system, and its superb audio performance.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2021",AF6SKKQSAPY2Q4GAS2DOPQBL7SOA,True,193,Size: SingleColor: White
RHGO648CL0OJY,B08Z1C8NM9,5.0 out of 5 stars Love the speaker but found an airplay issue,Miguel Gracia,5,"I really like this speaker, it is unique in the market because it is small, portable, wireless (can connect to your wifi ) and Bluetooth capable. I love to use it at home as desktop airplay speaker. One thing I experienced one time is when the speaker reached ~40% battery the airplay connection started to failed, sound was cutting really bad and I was not able to play continuously. not even I turned off/on. Once I connected to the power the problem was fixed so I am not sure if that was a glitch or something real. A second thing I don't like is that currently you have to open the SONOS app to check the battery level while airplaying it , I wish you can do the same from the airplay menu maybe that is an apple problem. Difficult to write about sound quality, I can only tell how it sounds compare to a apple homepod mini (similar sound quality less loud) , Bose Micro soundlink (Sonos has much better sound quality and louder) Bose Mini soundlink (Sonos has better sound quality, less bass, less loud) JBL clip 4 (sonos has ultra much better quality ). Overall I think this is the best small/micro sound system in the market, don't buy JBL clip 4 or Bose micro soundlink those are trash compare to this one.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2022",AFXJZ2PDN44L26NJFK2TGXKXTWXQ,True,24,Size: SingleColor: Black

If you have any kind of arthritis stop reading now and pick a different speaker. Especially if you need to reset the speaker you have to hold this button for an interminable amount of time.- the speaker comes with a charging cable but not a charging cube. And that would be a non issue if the speaker didn't require a minimum of 10watt power supply from the port it's plugged into. Once I read what was required and bought a more powerful charging cube my issues with the speaker were resolved and I didn't need to return it.,"Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2024",AFIQGQTRUU7EL6WLA7VBEVTVGHRQ,True,2,Size: SingleColor: White

RCP5UH68U3S6L,B08Z1C8NM9,3.0 out of 5 stars Sonos' most disappointing product is almost acceptable,JOSHUA,3,"The Roam is a small speaker, for which you're going to have to expect lower audio quality. This thing definitely does not have the somewhat richer sound of a One. Being able to pop the plug and take it with me is great and the battery life is excellent but the Roam has some pretty significant flaws that would make me not recommend it.It has very fine-grained volume controls yet everything below about 25% is almost completely inaudible. With other Sonos products you can comfortably set the volume to 10% and have an enjoyable listening experience. With the Roam you're going to literally wonder if it's on at all until you turn it up to about 28. It doesn't matter what source you use -- a test signal at full signal won't even be audible in the lower 20% of the volume band.This leads to the second problem: if you set the volume to a point where you can actually hear music, the Alexa voice is EAR SHATTERINGLY LOUD. If you set the volume to the point where Alexa isn't trying to make you have a heart attack, your music is inaudible.The software's a bit buggy as well. It can't be paired with any of your other speakers but it can be grouped with them. If you group the Roam with another speaker that's playing you have about a 50/50 shot of it just not doing anything at all. It'll be connected, the controls will respond, it'll be visible in the app as grouped, you just won't get any audio. After a little fooling around with it, you can sometimes work around the problem by starting the playback on the Roam and grouping something else to it. Adding the Roam to a group doesn't work reliably at all.Some other software bugs make this thing a bit less fun. While it remembers if it was last used in Bluetooth or in Sonos mode and will return to the selected mode when turned on again, it's not very reliable to switch between modes. This isn't something you normally have to do often unless you take your Roam out of the house a lot; just leaving it in the Sonos network is viable wherever your WiFi reaches. Take it on a trip, though, and you're going to spend the first 4 or 5 minutes trying to get it to actually switch into Bluetooth mode.Re-pairing the Bluetooth is similarly annoying. It doesn't pair with more than a single device so it's extra steps for switching who's DJing. This isn't a problem while the Roam is at home and participating in your Sonos setup, of course.My real complaint, though, and something that was exceedingly poorly documented when the product was released is that it DOES NOT PAIR WITH ANYTHING except another Roam.Battery life, as I said, is great. This comes at something of a cost, though: this sucker is way heavier than it looks. Personally, I'd have preferred half the (excellent!) battery life if it meant more room in there for better actual speakers. The audio is, really, barely passable at best and outright embarrassing for something Sonos branded.It is not tunable with TruePlay. It claims to have some kind of automatic TruePlay learning mode but I have not in any way noticed an improvement in the disappointing sound quality with it running.The Roam is definitely better than a no-name Bluetooth speaker you'd buy at Target. That faint praise is the strongest endorsement I can give it. If you want to pay nearly two Franklins for something that sounds pretty close to a $16 thing you bought when you went to pick up motor oil, the Roam is it.","Reviewed in the United States September 18, 2022",AGZ4XODB2UJ4NPOBG5WUPBF6JYIA,True,96,Size: SingleColor: Black

Got the Roam even after reading about the difficulty setting it up. It took days to sort out the issue which required my own workaround.Sonos has been trying to force the software update to the S2 app, which will not work with my older equipment. When trying to set up the Roam, I installed the S2 app, connected to a separate Wi-Fi network, but, as many users report, I could not set up a new account as any email address I entered was reported as ‚Äúalready in use‚Äù, which was impossible. Once I called Sonos, that issue disappeared which is suspicious. I wonder if they have something internal to prevent this.Sonos support told me to unplug all my devices, then set up the Roam on a split system which I refused to do as I did not want to risk my old equipment not working. Once you set up S2, you cannot revert back, so do not do this.I ignored their advice, and was somehow able to create the new Sonos account and activate my Roam. All that should be unnecessary for users like me that only want it for Bluetooth play.To Sonos - if you want to be in the Bluetooth market, change your software to enable Bluetooth only and stop trying to force loyal customers to the S2.

Pair the device to the app - wait it can't find the chip that tells it the PIN so you have to read it off the device but it's written in -2pt type (screams) so go find a magnifying glass4. Pair your app to your wifi network (what if you don't have a wifi network?)5. Ooops - now you have to update the Fing software6. O no, it cannot connect to the software server (head blows up)7. Try again. You have to login again - Wife says F this and let me use the old device8. Try again - it finally connects and downloads the new software.9. Pair the device AGAIN and repeat the PIN nightmare10. Finally get music to play but only with Airplay (through the wifi network) - there isn't an obvious way to get the bluetooth part to actually workWhy do you have to create a Sonos account?Why can't it ship with the latest software (yeah I know) but it should still work without the need to update it - that's just BS?Why can't the bluetooth work out of the box and connect like a normal bluetooth device?It's just a lame approach to require your customers to HAVE to use an app.Never again will I purchase a Sonos device of any kind.

R28UJU882WYS97,B08Z1C8NM9,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good Sound, Limited Instructions",HistoryBuff,3,"I received the Sonos Roam this week and proceeded to set it up. First, nothing about this set up is intuitive. The instructions are a joke, because they are almost non-existent. I spent two hours figuring out the steps through a myriad of YouTube videos, the Sonos website, and following the instructions on the app. First you need to download the app, set up an account, and connect to your Wifi and Bluetooth (if you want Bluetooth), information which is non-existent in the sparse instructions. Another feature that could use improvement are the buttons. The top with the volume and mike controls are hard to see and the button on the back is a bit funky. I didn't rate this product on the battery life since I've only had it for a short time. The saving grace for this product is the sound quality, which seems fairly good. Sonos could improve this product in a number of ways, so if you purchase it, the speaker seems good enough for the price, but unless you are a total techie, be prepared to fiddle around with the set-up---it's no cake walk.","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2023",AFBMRJ5DK2Y5LKIM54JW5A5DK7ZA,True,8,Size: SingleColor: Black

But I am so unhappy with this product that I just had to give it a poor review. I purchased two Sonos roam speakers for my small business. One for the front and one for the back of the store. And I have had nothing but problems. I chose the Sonos roam speakers because I liked the idea of being able to hook up multiple speakers wirelessly. Which seemed like it would be perfect for my store. But I tried everything to get this product to work correctly. I went through every troubleshooting procedure possible on so many different occasions with the Sonos company, that I have lost count. I can get one speaker to work correctly, but I cannot get both speakers to work at the same time with any consistency. While one speaker is working and playing music perfectly fine the other one will play music for a couple of minutes and then it will cut out for anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes and then just come back on for no apparent reason. Sometimes it‚Äôs the front speaker. Sometimes it‚Äôs the back speaker. And every now and then they will both work properly for a period of time and then all of a sudden I‚Äôm back on the phone with Sonos trying to figure out the problem. And still it does not work! So, unless you want a lot of frustration, and unless you want to be on the phone with Sonos on a regular basis, I would suggest trying a different product!","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2024",AEWA4UDDOCAU4PLSJZWTMK2C45BA,True,3,Size: 2-PackColor: White

They have abandoned their customer base and will have a very hard time regaining our trust. After all, it costs almost nothing to maintain the original S1 and S2 controllers.

Just like with mine half the time it had no battery, but even better when we would try to charge it, all we would get is a solid orange light. It would never charge, and would not turn on. If we unplugged/replugged the power tons of times, eventually it would start charging, but frequently would not connect to the wifi and would not show up in anyone's bluetooth. Can't tell you how frustrating this was, resetting the device, resetting the app, trying both of our phones. Maddening.

It can only connect when it's plugged in, which totally defeats the purpose.Update 05/20/2024 - I replaced my old Logitech system with 8 Sonos products, a very expensive endeavor. For a while I was quite happy, as I could listen to both streaming services and my large library of music that is not available on streaming services. If I wanted to add a song to my current queue, it was a simple 2 click operation.However, for some reason, they decided to roll out an app update that eliminated all options to modify the current queue. In addition, they app has no ability to modify system settings, so when I changed my wifi password (which I do on a monthly basis), I lost the connection to all of my devices. So now I have 8 Sonos products that I cannot listen to, and I'm now faced with once again having to replace my system.My advice: avoid Sonos.

R3FXXMYB4LCBKF,B07DD3VXRZ,1.0 out of 5 stars The worst speaker every when used as two or more together,Charles Magnuson,1,"The media could not be loaded. I have two opinions of the Ultimate Ears Boom speakers.When used as a single speaker, the Ultimate Ears Boom 3 speaker works well. The sound quality and loudness are good for a speaker of its size. The Bluetooth range is rather pathetic as I lose connection after moving about 20 feet away from the speaker's audio source, but I blame Bluetooth for being a lousy wireless standard more than the speaker for that fault. The speaker can be used every day in the shower with no negative repercussions. Overall, the Boom 3 speaker is a great speaker when used by itself.The situation completely changes when attempting to use two or more Boom speakers together. I'll go into details below, but I can confidently say that I've experienced few pieces of technology that are more unreliable and frustrating than the Boom 3 speakers when trying to get them paired together and playing the same audio.First, the Ultimate Ears Boom app is a huge frustration. Getting even a single speaker to show up in the app can require multiple disconnects, app force quits, and speaker restarts. Once a primary speaker shows up in the UE Boom app, getting other speakers to show up is near impossible. Each and every day I want to use the speakers together, I have to go through a 20-minute process of forgetting Bluetooth settings, repairing, and powering off and on speakers. It is such a frustrating process that I usually rage quit and forgo using the speakers together.Then, once the speakers are connected together they regularly start clicking and thumping as they stutter during audio playback. Even when I move the two speakers within a foot of each other and the audio source, they regularly and constantly stutter and lose bits of audio. Listening to an entire song without missing parts is impossible when using the Ultimate Ears Boom speakers together in Party Up or Two-Up mode.Simply put, THESE SPEAKERS DO NOT WORK WHEN PAIRED TOGETHER. The Boom speakers are completely worthless when used together as the audio they play is unlistenable.I really enjoyed the single Ultimate Ears Boom speaker I used on its own for about two years, but after experiencing the disaster which is Party Up mode and the Ultimate Ears Boom app, I will never again purchase another Ultimate Ears product. This experience has just been too frustrating and I've wasted $300 on two speakers I cannot use together.","Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2018",AFN57XUWIRHZ24FA7IVOW5HXLL2Q,True,283,Color: Sunset RedPattern: Speaker
R3E39REOEKMJHO,B07DD3VXRZ,2.0 out of 5 stars DO NOT BUY: Ruined my relationship with ULTIMATE EARS :(,Hailey DeArruda,2,"üíóLet me start by saying before buying this product I have been a HUGE, longtime fan of the Ultimate Ears brand.I purchased the original Wonderboom portable bluetooth speaker maybe 5 years ago or longer? I originally purchased it because I wanted something waterproof that I could use in the shower. It was GREAT for that purpose, and also proved to be an awesome all-around portable bluetooth speaker. Sound quality was great for the price range and size. Volume was SUPER as well. I loved the big loop on the back that you could hang on all sorts of things. I LOVE the concept of the Magic Button in the center to Play, Pause & Skip. The Skip Feature is ESPECIALLY hard to find on a speaker in this price range and I love it for use at work when I may not be able to easily access my phone. Bluetooth connection was great. Battery life originally lasted anywhere between 4-6hrs at least which was great. THIS SPEAKER LASTED ME AT LEAST 5 YEARS with little to no change in quality. I LOVED THIS SPEAKER! Unfortunately, I left it at work one week when I was on vacation and just left it there figuring my coworkers could use it and would respect it enough. Long story short, I came back and it wasn't working as well or holding a charge properly. It was a sad end to a good story.üîçFinally, I find myself in need of a new speaker. Because I LOVED my original WONDERBOOM so much, I decided to search within the Ultimate Ears line.((It also just so happens at my current job our department owns two WONDERBOOM2 speakers! I've noticed their battery life doesn't work as well, but they still worked pretty decent.))So I wanted one of the newest, nicest speakers in the Ultimate Family. The Hyperboom was too large to transport from home and work, and cost way more than I was looking to spend, so that was out of the question. So immediately I decided to research between the BOOM3 & the MEGABOOM3. In conclusion, through reviews I read I concluded that most consumers felt the bass was overpowering for the Megaboom3 with no real volume increase, and simply diminished the quality of the sound. SO, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE BOOM3!1Ô∏è‚É£üÜïFirst impression out of the box, it looked nice enough. I preferred the more compact design of the Wonderboom, and DEFINITELY missed the larger, more practical loop. It still has the magic button which is a HUGE selling point to me and very accommodating.I charged it up to 100% and decided to unplug it and test it out for a while at home. It worked well, sounded almost exactly like the Wonderboom as far as sound QUALITY. I might be wrong but as far as VOLUME goes I feel it may have had the same volume limitations as the original Wonderboom, if anything maybe SLIGHTLY louder. However, I was happy it seemed to be fully functioning and worked just as well as my other one.I also liked that in addition to that, I was able to use the Ultimate Ears app in conjunction with the product to REMOTE START the speaker from my phone. Again, this is another HUGE selling point to me because I mainly use this product at work. It also has an EQUALIZER function which is definitely cool, although I don't feel like it's very accurate. It also has some sort of feature where you can set certain clicks on the Magic Button to play certain playlists automatically, which sounds cool although I never got to personally try it.All in all, it seemed like a good replacement at first.‚ö†Ô∏èü™´THE NEXT DAY COMES & HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEMS BEGIN. I come into work with my charger FULLY charged at 100%. I use Remote-Start on the app to turn on the speaker. The Remote-Start feature also displays the approximate battery percentage (by 10% increments) of the speaker. At this point, my speaker was at 100% charge.I used the speaker for between 1.5hrs<2hrs before it gave me the Low Battery warning for 10%. So, I put it on the charger and continued to let it play. It lasted maybe another 20minutes, before it died.Now this is VERY disappointing considering my ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM that came out 5+ years ago would last for 4-6hrs on FULL VOLUME without being on a charger. Not only that, but the ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM would ALSO last for a WHILE on the charger even when battery wasn't full.This was disappointing, but didn't seem like a crisis, just a bit sad.The next day, is when the BIGGER issue began. I admittedly forgot to charge my BOOM3 when I got home the night before, and then brought it to work. When I wake up, I charge it until I leave for 1.5HOURS!When I arrive at work, I charge it for an additional 1HOUR before, checking the battery percentage on the app which reads 60%. So, I decide to turn it on and use it while STILL LEAVING IT ON THE CHARGER. NOT EVEN 30 MINUTES GO BY UNTIL THE SPEAKER DIES!!!!!!!!! So, irritated I turn it off, opt for my AirPods and leave the speaker to charge for a few hours. I let this SPEAKER CHARGE FOR 4 MORE HOURS BEFORE USING IT. Finally, I check the battery on the app which only says 40%????? So I turn on the speaker and leave it plugged in, IT LASTS FOR LESS THAN ONE SONG BEFORE DYING!LET ME TELL YOU, THIS SPEAKER BROUGHT OUT PURE RAGE IN ME AT WORK. ü™´‚ö†Ô∏èüò°I feel so pissed, and cheated and ripped off. I was such a big fan and advocate for the Ultimate Ears brand, but how are you gonna sell me a NEWER, MORE EXPENSIVE speaker and MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY worse. Considering this is the BOOM3, I WOULD HOPE & ASSUME IT IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL WONDEBOOM FROM 5 YEARS AGO, BUT I GUESS NOT. Thanks, Logitech, just charge me more money for a FAR INFERIOR PRODUCT, with the illusion that is going to be somewhat improved. However; this speaker is simply, for my needs- UNUSABLE & FRUSTRATING!!! HUUUUUGE DOWNGRADE üëéüò¢Very, very disappointed in the Ultimate Ears brand for putting out this one. Like I sad it really is a shame because I was a HUGE supporter of their brand and unfortunately this product was so disappointing and frustrating that it has ruined my relationship with this company for good.I loved the convenience of the Magic Button with the Skip Feature, the portability, durability, great waterproof technology, super big, useful loop, the sound quality & volume, and the battery life of ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM, but this product has ruined all that unfortunately.‚ö†Ô∏èDO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SAVE YOUR MOMEY üí∏ BECAUSEYOU WILL NEED TO RETURN IT & REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER SPEAKER!!!!!!! THIS SPEAKER IS NOT FUNCTIONAL! ‚ö†Ô∏èSorry, Ultimate Ears, but do better.","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2022",AFSWDPDFGUZCY4TIBMKU2QD3275A,True,148,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

R1XX4TUH1QR3UL,B07DD3VXRZ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Buena calidad de sonido, pero...",Jorge Sarmiento,4,"Llevo tres meses utilizando el BOOM 3 y me parece pertinente hablar de sus caracter√≠sticas. Empecemos por las cosas buenas:1. CALIDAD DE SONIDOEs necesario resaltar la calidad tan excelsa de sonido que tiene este parlante. Los entendidos sabemos que la conexi√≥n por Bluetooth acarrea p√©rdida considerable en la calidad del sonido. Sin embargo, he de decir que el BOOM 3 me sorprendi√≥ sobremanera: agudos y medios en su punto y los bajos, aunque poco notorios y exagerados, son c√≥modos y audibles.2. VOLUMEN Y POTENCIAEl BOOM 3 es ideal para aquellos que quieran utilizarlo en una habitaci√≥n peque√±a o en una reuni√≥n o fiesta. Esto es as√≠ porque puede llegar a ser discreto y a la vez muy potente sin llegar a afectar demasiado la calidad de sonido.3. WATERPROOFNo he testeado el parlante sumergi√©ndolo de lleno en agua, pero se ha llegado a mojar levemente y hasta el momento no ha presentado problemas.Lleg√≥ la hora de hablar de lo malo:1. CARGA Y BATER√çASi bien es cierto que la duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a no es el fuerte de este aparato, uno esperar√≠a m√°s por algo que cuesta m√°s de cien d√≥lares. Hay aparatos much√≠simo m√°s econ√≥micos que tienen una carga m√°s duradera independientemente del uso. Si usas el BOOM 3 discretamente, la bater√≠a puede durar m√°s de 10 horas non-stop. Pero si usas el BOOM 3 con el volumen m√°ximo, la carga solo te va a durar cuatro o cinco horas (a menos que lo uses mientras est√© conectado a la energ√≠a). Se entiende que se hayan decantado por un uso m√°s discreto y se hayan enfocado en un parlante que provea una calidad de sonido √≥ptima, pero repito: este parlante cuesta m√°s de cien d√≥lares y me parece que la bater√≠a qued√≥ a deber.2. BUGS Y FUNCIONALIDADES IN√öTILESEl bot√≥n Magic est√° muy bien pero tiene muchos defectos. Por ejemplo, no reconoce si laa playlists que a√±adas est√°n en aleatorio y las termina reproduciendo por default. El conectar dos parlantes con la app me parece genial pero dudo mucho que alguien lo vaya a usar del todo. Con la app de Ultimate Ears no siempre puedes conectarte al aparato y en esos casos debes encenderlo manualmente. Hubo una vez que el aparato no respond√≠a a la conexi√≥n y, debido a que la caja no incluye un manual de instrucciones, tuve que buscar en internet para ver c√≥mo lo reseteaba por defecto.Resumiendo:Buena calidad de sonido, buena potencia y buena resistencia al agua. Mala distribuci√≥n de la carga y mal sistema de conexi√≥n.¬øVale la pena comprarlo? Depende de c√≥mo lo quieras usar. Si pretendes usar un parlante para un uso m√°s dom√©stico y disfrutar de la m√∫sica en una calidad de sonido decente, este es tu producto. Pero si quieres algo m√°s profesional o externo, puedes conseguir algo mejor.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2023",AE55TVZYQ4SFDSGABXMU7JPEDKFA,True,14,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

R10AD2QSAZA36K,B07DD3VXRZ,4.0 out of 5 stars Preferred this over Bose and JBL speakers,Tyler Cash,4,"I went to a Best Buy to look at portable bluetooth speakers. I was able to compare bluetooth speakers from Bose, JBL, and Ultimate Ears. Of all the speakers I listened to at this size and price point, this had the best sound. Best Buy didn't have any BOOM 3 speakers in stock, so I ordered from Amazon. Its been a definite upgrade from my previous similarly sized portable bluetooth speaker, with stronger bass hits and bigger sound overall. The bigger (and more expensive) speakers I listened to sounded better for sure, but the BOOM 3 does great for a more affordable speaker of its size.Its no audiophile speaker. It's tuned for popular music, with particular emphasis on bass and percussive hits. Which is fine, since that's what I was looking for and expecting from a speaker of this size and price. It does a decent job with today's top-40 style music. I don't listen to much rap or R&B, but I think it would do great with those genres as well. Music like Olivia Rodriguez's ""Good 4 U"" was pretty satisfying to listen to. Ultimate ears even provides an app where you can EQ the sound to something that you personally like even better.Music like ""Tightrope"" from the Greatest Showman soundtrack or ""Zanarkand"" from Final Fantasy Distant Worlds was a different story. They sounded muddy and lacked detail in a very unsatisfying way. I don't thing the EQ app can do anything to help that out. You'll want a different speaker if you're looking for a speaker for vocal, orchestral, jazz, etc.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2022",AFHDPQ3WBQQMUQNB46TWQCOSHXPQ,True,21,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

The inconsistent quality is frustrating and I will be looking for a different speaker now.I originally bought one in 2020 and it lasted me 3 years of almost daily use until it started cutting in and out. It would play music and then briefly cut out and back in (like a hiccup) every few minutes. I found it pretty annoying so I ordered a new one. This one was even worse as it started cutting in and out like the last one, but after only 3 weeks of use. I initiated a return, and hopefully I can get it because I threw the box away after I opened it. After 2 of the same speaker, I would say I don't really recommend this one because while my first one did last me 3 years and was great, it seems that the quality of them is inconsistent, so I will be looking for a different one soon.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2024",AE2V2FGKUSXIKL3U3IWWW4L42IKA,True,3,Color: Lagoon BluePattern: Speaker

R200IE3MUNI9EU,B07DD3VXRZ,5.0 out of 5 stars good size + sound quality,Omar Siddique,5,"Nice clear mids & decent bass, in an attractive device, make this an all-around winner.On the negative side: there's a mostly unnecessary app, oversized volume buttons, and a I'd prefer it had a USB-C power connector instead of the old ""micro"" connector.Over all, this is a great speaker. It also looks really nice, and feels solid in-hand. The UE is small/light enough that I use it as my travel speaker, although I prefer the boom-ier bass on my (heavier) JBL for workout and party music at home.This speaker sounds good, but not obtrusive-- natural for various genres. The default tuning is ""fine"". Unusual for a Bluetooth speaker, there is an EQ feature on the app, but it doesn't let you turn one band up without decreasing the others. Good for tuning the sound quality for eg, spoken podcasts, but you can't turn up the bass or the treble like you might on a usual sound system.The app also allows using the speaker's top ""smart"" button to automatically launch playlists without otherwise interacting with a device. A clever idea, but since I usually use an AI (like Google Assistant) I find it unnnecessary, and better to not have too many random apps installed. The speaker works beautifully without the app-- totally optional.I used to buy Logitech PC speakers long ago, and they still make good ""gaming"" speakers. It's interesting Logi acquired Ultimate Ears, a brand I hadn't heard of before. A good move on their part, as this is one of the two best speakers I tested recently in my search for the perfect hardware.Highly Recommended.","Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2020",AGMITI35DNIHMTUWA6JSEYH43FGQ,True,9,Color: Sunset RedPattern: Speaker

R1KELUR90PO5A3,B07DD3VXRZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speaker,Labcoated,5,"I've been putting this speaker through its paces for the last few hours and I'm really impressed. Sound quality, water resistance, and build quality is all there. The app is well designed, pairing is quick and easy, and bluetooth range covers my entire apartment.It's important to understand that you're not gonna get crazy sub bass on this thing, but that's not what they're trying to do here. One thing I really have to hand it to UE for on this speaker is instead of trying to reproduce frequencies in those bottom sub ranges, they have obviously set a hard shelf on the EQ that totally eliminates those frequencies from the mix rather than try to make the small speakers in this unit try for it anyway. A lot of other bluetooth speakers I've heard fail pretty hard at that and you end up with distortion and a lot of muddiness in the low range because of it. The tradeoff is that especially low end music (namely drum and bass, dubstep, 808 heavy hip hop and trap, etc) isn't going to exactly shine on this speaker.What does sound great, though, is just about everything else that doesn't rely on sub bass. Rock, jazz, metal, most hip hop, most electronic, funk, r&b, podcasts, etc all sound really clear and have great dynamics. This speaker is also capable of going extremely loud. I couldn't get it past around 70% volume in my apartment without it being excessive, yet the music sounded totally clear and free of distortion even when I cranked it.Also, I brought it in the shower to test and it got wet without issue and dried off quickly.I just got the speaker so time will tell how reliable it is, but count me as impressed. I'm looking forward to taking this on river floats next summer. Really happy that well made, waterproof electronics are readily available now. That was by far one of the biggest selling points to me after the sound quality.They should have used USB C, that's maybe my biggest gripe, I've never cared for micro USB.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2018",AGVINZPVX6XN7HFBN4XKCKCLOOCA,True,49,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

The sound was good and so was the Bluetooth range and the battery life is really good. It has notification sounds that play really loud but you can turn them off so that's not a big deal until you can't turn them off, or the speaker.6 months in the ""magic"" button got stuck. It was always a little touchy but it worked and I never paid it any mind but once it got stuck, none of the other buttons worked anymore. The volume and power buttons no longer responded because the magic button was constantly being pressed. There is an app and I could turn the power off that way but minutes later the power was back on because the magic button was depressed. It took days for the battery to run down and at certain intervals it would announce that some feature was not available and to check the aps internet connection, really loudly. When the battery finally ran down it started screaming that the battery was low every 30 seconds. i had to stash it out in the garage.I contacted support and they got back to me saying the warranty doesn't cover the stuck magic button because it was damaged, the kicker is I never said the speaker was damaged, only that the button was stuck.Since it was no longer covered I found a tutorial on how to take it apart and found that the screws that hold the switch in place were so tight that the switch didn't have room to release. I loosened the screws and the speaker is back to working like it should except it's no longer waterproof. That sounds like a manufacturing defect to me. I let Logitech support know what I found and we'll see what they have to say.I would have given the speaker 5 stars but the business with support knocks it down a couple notches in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2020",AHRLZLHRJOA3UFOB2ZV5EEI2EO2A,True,2,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

I'm not a snob when it comes to portable speakers, great sound is achieved under controlled circumstances with much better equipment, this is good for what it is!The app is nice, but doesn't add a lot for me, I can get most of the functions it provides elsewhere, except for the battery level, nice to check before heading out for a day or weekend.The only small flaw I've found to date is the lack of being able to answer a phone call with it. I'm torn on how important of a feature that really is, but it feels like they could have added it and still kept their minimal, clean, very simple controls in tact.I'm very happy with this speaker and it's sort of become my go-to, it's beating out a number of very nice options!","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2019",AEFX2A4BHG3TUNVA5QUDPFTZB77Q,True,8,Color: Lagoon BluePattern: Speaker
RDTJ4OJICTP06,B07DD3VXRZ,"2.0 out of 5 stars Stopped charging after a month, good sound, bad bluetooth, awkward charge cord",Ammon,2,"The sound was good while it lasted. Issues that may concern potential buyers: 1. My Boom3 stopped charging after about a month. It doesn't come with a power adapter. Their instructions and FAQ say to charge using any USB power adapter. I charged it using a surge protector with built-in USB ports. The tiny white charging indicator light has stopped lighting up. The device can recognize that it's plugged into an outlet, but it won't charge. I can't use the speaker anymore, and when I try to turn it on the voice just says, ""Charging, please wait."" I've tried other plugs and cords, but no luck. I'm just outside the Amazon return window (sucks because I want a refund) so I'll have to check if the company will exchange or credit it under warranty. 2. Was hoping to use it with my PC, but audio keeps cutting out even though speaker is right next to the case. I tried the troubleshooting tips in their FAQ multiple times, followed other user threads and tips, but never got it working well. All other bluetooth products I have (including noise cancelling headphones and testing it with my spouse's JBL speaker) worked fine. I even unpaired and ""forgot"" everything, then reconnected only the the Boom3... still cutting out at regular intervals. This is a pre-built gaming PC and only a few years old, so I really don't think it's the PC's fault. I found numerous people online with similar issues. 3. The cord that comes with this for charging is disappointing. It is micro USB, which means it is awkward to insert. Why not use USB-C on a newer product like this? The cord is solid white, so it looks garish plugged into my black Boom 3. Also, the plug housing is a big square, but the Boom3 charge slot is inside an oval recess - it's very snug and awkward to plug in. Finally, the cord is a flat/ribbon style - it does not want to go where you want it to go.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2022",AF2JAXPNOHN4CQ523YQQWVNAZ5VA,True,2,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

I installed the phone app and chose the ""more bass"" selection on one of the automatic equalizer selections. The equalizer produced much improved sound quality in my opinion.

RIM63S708LP9L,B07DD3VXRZ,3.0 out of 5 stars Not what they used to be,Ivan T,3,"What happened to UE? They used to have great bluetooth speakers. I just read that they were bought by Altec Lansing which explains the drop in sound quality. I owned a UE Boom 1st model and 2nd model and they were amazing. So of course I would buy this model the 3rd gen. Well I was disappointed. First it is not LOUD like the previous models. Bass is sub par but then again UE wasnt really know for heavy bass. So first, I tried the volume at Max outside to see how it was. It was decent but not loud like the other gens. 2nd issue is u will need to download their app to get the most of the speaker but even the app provides minimal improvements. Battery life is better I will say but aound just isnt what it used to be. I would send it back but I gave away my other 2 gens to friends when I ordered this. Do yourself a favor. Buy a bose link instead because this doesnt do it. And the 360 immersive sound that it claims is definitely missing. Disappointed in this speaker to say the least.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2022",AHDRTT26OA2NWGHZIQ4XNIKAJDRA,True,6,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

R35NBQEDPO572,B07DD3VXRZ,2.0 out of 5 stars Bluetooth connection continues to randomly cut out.,RSTILL,2,"Bluetooth connection to my Boom 3 speakers is sub-par and unacceptable for something in this price range. I own two identical speakers which were bought at separate times and have the issue with both.The problem is that the Bluetooth connection randomly cuts in & out, similar to a popping. Happening in different environments, with different transmitting devices and also in daisy chain connections which is so bad that I can not use multiple speakers together. The problem is not consistent, I have checked the firmware level in the Boom app and it shows it is up to date. My two speakers experience the issue at all distances from the phone which range from sitting on the device, next to the device and then any distance range until it's to far to maintain connection.The issue comes and goes and has been happening more lately which is driving my dissatisfaction and this review. I really wanted this to be a good purchase so have given multiple chances for them to work at an acceptable level.I do not recommend the Boom 3 to anyone unless you get a serious discount and do not expect consistent sound. I'll definitely try another brand when I get so fed up with these that I just donate them away.Side note, it seems like BT can be spiritic on other speakers too so perhaps it's worth it to just get a speaker that offers a hard connection to avoid the frustrating situations when you want consistent sound over portability.","Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2023",AHDQACXK3VYQ6HYHHKFU3PNQSJBQ,True,0,Color: Ultraviolet PurplePattern: Speaker

Before I did this, the battery never got past 20%. I looked on the internet and that seems to be a common problem that is fixed by a firmware update, which requires the app. To me, that is a shady practice. People should download the app if they *want*, not because they literally have no choice because the battery indicator is broken without it.

RL16ZWDRDNUEI,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product with usage caveats,Omar Enrique Ferrer,5,"A few months ago I had an epiphany. When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",AEFUDKDNGZTOEP2BCFB4CLUELCYQ,True,155,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

R1N4D4CK1JMIVB,B09XXW54QG,4.0 out of 5 stars Three + 1/2 stars.,Sophie's6,4,"Feels churlish to give just three stars. 3.5 imo. So to the point. I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom. Easy & seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max. Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn‚Äôt need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine‚Äôish considering the size of speaker. It‚Äôs fine for background music if you‚Äôre flexible on sound quality as long as you don‚Äôt play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone‚Äôs speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less. The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I‚Äôm at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine. But what is the point of the app? I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features. Maybe bass and treble controls? The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off. lolFine retro look, sturdy, small footprint and working out for podcasts. Do not think the app is or will be helpful.If I were to try another I‚Äôd probably go with the Klipsch of similar design. It‚Äôs approximately $50 more but better sound and working app.Remove $25 dollars off price on the Em II and it‚Äôs a fair deal.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",AHIQF7PWHKOE36B564CMAEITLRDQ,True,9,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

RVQU04O5Y7EP5,B09XXW54QG,4.0 out of 5 stars Rich sound - with the right music,Brett Williams,4,"What I liked most about this unit was the dual driver system where you can get a more stereo sound than other Bluetooth speakers that are more mono (unless you pair a few together). The battery lasting up to 30 hours is impressive, though I didn't just it more than a few hours and couldn't speak to what real-time is. The top metal multi-directional button is very nice and premium feel......however the textured top/rubber surround makes reading the Volume/Track directions virtually impossible to see - you get used to it, but it would be nice if they were a little more visible.I will say that I'm disappointed in 2024, we're still seeing devices with Bluetooth 5.1, considering that it was released in 2016 and 5.3 has been out since 2021.With the driver's front and back-firing, I found that I got a wider sound by turning the unit sideways so that I was looking at the side of the unit while the drivers fired left and right.I listen to just about anything, and other were songs where the speaker excelled, but then others where it sounded very flat, and it's because of the inconsistency that I returned it. I will say that I liked it much more than the JBL's that I tested against which had almost zero depth comparatively, but for a little more I got something that, while larger, has a better sound presence.I was tempted to keep this as an alternative, but I think over time I would probably get annoyed with some songs sounding flat and others very deep and rich (or course tracks and recording quality matter, but compared to other speakers I tested I didn't see as big of a swing between the same songs).","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AEZLB3QWTROAPNV3SIQVKNOFDS3Q,True,2,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

R13A8CEV5KJI8M,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars So Cool...,John Farrell,5,"I visited a friend on Florida recently and he's building a new house. We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term.

Initially I found the control button kind of fiddly, but now that I have the hang of it I can manage it easily.Mostly I use this at home when watching movies or listening to the news with some music thrown in. A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is. However, if you can get it on sale (as I did) and bring the price down under $100, I think it's worth it.","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024",AE23D3SJBYXFUO7OXEAFXXTU2IPA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton

There is no ability to toggle any sort of EQ. So the sound you hear, is the sound you get. The thing that I like least about this speaker is the function button. There is only one that you depress in N,S,E, and W for different abilities, but it is loose. It wobbles around like a loose tooth. I would prefer a nice tight button that snaps in each direction.

R1PKWJ1ZABTB2S,B09XXW54QG,"5.0 out of 5 stars Love, love, love, and love...",Su Doki,5,"So good, I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton. As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house. For now, I'm pretty satisfied.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2023",AFG3MMBXL5ODHUR3EXHWYGOHLNXA,True,22,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

Then a friend introduced me to the Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, claiming it's as good or better than his fancy B&O speaker, but less than half the price.Now, when I saw the Marshall speaker's price tag at $128.00, I hesitated. I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did! The Marshall speaker not only shattered my expectations with its deep bass and distortion-free music, even at volumes that could make my ears bleed.

The lower rating is due to the speaker's inability to go to a really low volume that I wanted for it to be a low key speaker for the bedroom. Also, Marshall allows pairing of speakers to play the same sound, or in stereo, but that apparently is only for when you have two of the same speakers. I have one of their larger speakers that I love, so I was very disappointed that their app doesn't allow pairing of two of their speakers that aren't identical. If you don't care about really low volume music or pairing with a different Marshall speaker, I can't recommend this more highly.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2023",AGQUN3KJYYOJNSILZUNTYO2M6FBA,True,2,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

R2X7MVZ50QBR2H,B08VL5S148,"5.0 out of 5 stars As someone who had the first version since 2017, this is a noticeable improvement",Phoenix Lain,5,"TLDR: Great sound quality, great portability and size, and holds a good charge (5-6 hours at 50% - 70% volume.) The charging cradle is a must own if you buy this. It‚Äôs durable and holds up well, but it can dent and ding with relative ease; but it doesn‚Äôt effect the sound quality. I got more than 5+ years out of my first one, and it still works. The Bose app is great and easy to link multiple devices. Where this speaker absolutely shines is in Party Mode/Stereo Mode. It actually gives my Bose Smart Soundbar 900 a run (Only possible with two of these revolve+ in Stereo Mode; however, you can link any other Bose Soundlink speakers to it as well.) Silver hides dirt better than the black, but the black handle hides dirt better than the silver handle. The black also hides dents and dings a little better. One downside is the charging cradle only comes in black. If you can wait patiently, and would like to save some money; you can find this around $100 off retail during black Friday sales, Amazon Day sales, and during random flash sales.The first one I owned was a Silver Soundlink Revolve+ that I used daily, for roughly 5 years. Then after getting a PC, and finding out my monitor didn‚Äôt have speakers, I decided I wanted one more to connect with my PC (since I was always moving my silver series 1 back and forth.)But after seeing how effortlessly it connects to bluetooth, and being able to tell a difference in the quality of sound (from heavy everyday use for 5+ years) I felt like it would bother me. Before I hadn‚Äôt noticed it, but after comparing them directly, and using party mode/stereo mode (linking them ) I could tell my silver OG soundlink revolve+ was just a touch not as clear. If both were new, I‚Äôm pretty sure the only difference between the two would be the ease of bluetooth connection on the series 2 (this one.) The battery is pretty much about the same in my experience, but honestly I leave it on the cradle 95% of the time. If I had to guess, I‚Äôd say the Series 2 might be slightly better overall, but I‚Äôm inclined to think it has more with the software than a battery upgrade.However, it‚Äôs nice to grab and walk through the house from chore to chore while listening to an audiobook, podcast, or other media content. As far as portable speakers go, I think this is right in the pocket. It‚Äôs compact enough that it‚Äôs easily packed in a backpack, or drawstring bag; but it‚Äôs also loud enough that it‚Äôs worth carrying with you. Honestly, some smaller lower quality speakers just aren‚Äôt really worth the trouble. For example, my first Jambox, or my first JBL portable speaker. Those were both pretty mid to be honest, neither lasted more than 1.5 years.The sound quality is supurb, and has a nice overall balance between the high‚Äôs and bass. It‚Äôs very clear, even when it‚Äôs loud. My only recommendation would be to buy the charging cradle as it makes everything so much easier. I do feel like for the price it should include the charging cradle, but whatever.Ultimately, I was happy enough with the series 1 Soundlink Revolve+ that I decided to add another one. Then after hearing the sound degradation after 5 years, I decided to buy another. Honestly, without comparing them side by side, you‚Äôd never notice. But unfortunately I did, and then it always bothered me. I decided to retire my OG Silver Soundlink Revolve+ and gave it to a friend. He couldn‚Äôt believe I would give it away like that, but I assured him that I got every penny out of those 5+ years. He‚Äôs been using the OG revolve+ for more than a year now. And I‚Äôve been using my two Series 2 revolve+ for more than a year as well. Both have held up great even with daily use. For reference, I usually listen at around 50% - 70% volume. Where this speaker really shines is in Party Mode/Stereo Mode with two of these Revolve + speakers. It honestly gives my Bose Smart Soundbar a good and close run. It‚Äôs a pretty pricy investment, but it can be easier to justify knowing you‚Äôll easily get 5+ years out of it. Just don‚Äôt have it turned up to 100 all the time for hours at a time, and it should last you a very long time.PS: In all honesty, I think the Silver hides dirty and grime better than the black does. It sounds like the opposite would be true, but the black show‚Äôs every spec of dust, and finger prints standout a lot more. The only downside was the charging cradle only comes in black. The only benefit to the black color in my experience is that the black handle does hide dirt better. So it‚Äôs kind of a trade off. I got the black speakers this time around just as a refresher, I kinda wanted it to feel new and unfamiliar. In all honesty, after spending a year with the black, I‚Äôd say personally I prefer the silver. But the black does match the cradle, and it the handle hides dirt a little better. The black also hides dents and dings a little better too, but not by much. After 5+ years with OG revolve+ it had a number of smaller dents from being knocked around, thrown, falling off the table/desk, etc.. it‚Äôs made well, and you no doubt get what you pay for.","Reviewed in the United States September 18, 2023",AHJFDIUB6JRTAIMCQ3K3VNMWF6SA,True,68,Color: Black
RP9RA3M8VT6JQ,B08VL5S148,"5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing speaker, but why no USBC?!?!?",Jeremy,5,"I treated myself to the Bose SoundLink speaker, and am glad I chose this over some other less expensive options. I am genuinely blown away by its exceptional performance and versatility.THE GOOD- Build: From the moment I unboxed the Bose SoundLink, I was immediately impressed by its sleek and modern design. Its compact form factor makes it incredibly portable, and the build quality is outstanding. The soft-touch materials and sturdy construction exude a sense of durability that assures me it's built to last.- Sound: The real magic, however, lies in its audio performance. The SoundLink delivers a rich, immersive sound that's hard to believe could come from a speaker of this size. The bass response is surprisingly punchy, mids are clear and vibrant, and the highs are crisp without being harsh. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music, streaming podcasts, or watching movies, the sound quality is consistently phenomenal.- Connectivity: One feature that sets the SoundLink apart from the competition is its impressive Bluetooth connectivity. Pairing my devices is a breeze, and the connection remains stable even when I'm in another room. The wireless range is quite impressive, allowing me to move freely without worrying about losing the connection.- Battery: Another standout feature is the battery life. I've used it for hours on end without needing to recharge, making it a reliable companion for extended listening sessions or outdoor adventures. The convenience of having a portable speaker with such a long-lasting battery is a game-changer.THE MEDIOCRE- Charging cable: Not a huge deal, but not having a USBC on a premium product purchased in 2023 is a miss. The micro USB has worked well over the past 6 months, but I still would much prefer the new standard USBC cable and can't fathom why it wasn't included in this version of the speaker.- Voice: For a premium speaker in 2023, I also thoguht the voice would be improved and sound more natural. Every time I turn this on, it automatically connects to my phone and says, ""Connected to ..."". The voice it uses to say this seems like it is from 2011 when Siri was introduced. It's by no means a deal breaker, but my expectation was higher at this pricepoint.What truly sets the Bose SoundLink apart, though, is its remarkable portability. I've taken it on hikes, to the beach, and even used it at picnics, and it has never disappointed. The built-in handle is a thoughtful addition, making it easy to carry, and its water-resistant design offers peace of mind during unexpected rain showers.In summary, the Bose SoundLink is a powerhouse of a portable speaker, offering impressive sound quality, ease of use, and incredible portability. It has quickly become an essential part of my daily life, ensuring that I never compromise on audio quality, no matter where I go. If you're looking for a portable speaker that delivers outstanding performance, look no further. The Bose SoundLink is a true gem, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a premium audio experience on the go.","Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2023",AHCOIYZTARA6FT4VPO2FFR2OBMQA,True,56,Color: Black

R1RFJO1FULF3WU,B08VL5S148,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good, not great",Christopher Hansen,3,"Update after a month of useI like this unit more than I did initially.While it‚Äôs not as powerful as some of its competitors, it does shine in several categories.This unit really excels in smaller spaces. It really does well when it‚Äôs placed in a corner. It‚Äôs 360 degree sound profile uses the walls to bounce and project sound, using the corner walls as a pseudo speaker cabinet. Sound is much richer used this way.Portability is also a key ingredient. Size and form factor plat a big part. The ‚Äòkiller feature‚Äô is the handle. I know that sounds dumb, but it is really, really useful.The lithium ion battery is also a monster. Took this to the beach, boating and back to a bbq, and only used 25% of the battery life after a full day of activity.The Bose Connect app is what everyone else should aspire to. No gimmicky features. Start it up, connect to your paired device and then stream whatever audio you want from any app.The unit supports multiple people connecting to it simultaneously via Bose Connect so no more ‚Äòwait while I un-pair‚Äô so a friend can play the next song.I‚Äôve also found this is a great audio pairing option for laptop and desktop audio. Much better sound quality than stock speakers, wireless Bluetooth freedom. Our old 27‚Äô‚Äô iMac is in the guest bedroom and we paired this to create a simple audio video system that works quite well for when guests visit.I also use the device occasionally when we golf.When I tested it out at the beach, sound quality was average to good and loudness was enough that we found ourselves constantly turning it down so as to not offend people nearby.Previous review points (below) still apply. Probably would boost it a star if it were cheaper. $300+tax is a big bite for a device of this size. I will keep the unit. I did decide to keep the unit, but mostly just because I can afford to do so.Purchased this unit based upon a ton of positive reviews. Bose clearly took a page out of the Apple design playbook. Very well designed. The handle is a simple, yet awesome feature. The unit is a lot smaller than the pictures depicts.Top quality packaging, and simple setup make using this a breeze. Requires the Bose Connect app from the App Store. The device is primarily intended to be paired to a mobile device or tablet. Skip the Bose opt in (as if we need yet another account and more emails, kthx)Here‚Äôs the rub:While this is an interesting Bluetooth device, it‚Äôs a VERY expensive device. By comparison I paid about $50 more for a HEOS 5 that blows this out of the water in terms of sound quality. While the HEOS isn‚Äôt portable, the bar is pretty high.Overall sound quality is ok, not amazing. Lots of mid range and treble. Bass is present but it‚Äôs not very pronounced. ‚ÄòAcceptable‚Äô but not great.Overall volume output is good, but it‚Äôs not sensational. You‚Äôre not going to throw any keggers or raves. I suspect a small to medium sized group of people wouldn‚Äôt enjoy this very much if they were super talkative of having a lot of fun. I think for lounging on the deck it would be fine. I question whether this unit would be very good for outdoor use. It just doesn‚Äôt have the oomf power to produce enough volume, and I suspect sound quality would be a lot less also.It‚Äôs definitely not a home stereo replacement.Overall 3 stars. Good, not great. If it was $150 it would get another star.For the money involved, you should be able to get some kick $&@ equipment. This unit is decent, but severely overpriced. You‚Äôre paying for the Bose name and a big lithium battery. My daughter‚Äôs Bose Soundlink color puts out almost as much wattage and better Bass at 1/3 the cost.I don‚Äôt think that I can justify keeping this unit for what it cost.ProsGreat form factorHandle!Easy setupSuper long batteryGood soundApp connectConsPriceSound quality could be a lot betterVolume limited - easy to cap outNo sound shaping controls","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2021",AHYUW5WTHPVO4V44CXRAT7REJMUQ,True,207,Color: Silver

R2O0P800Q6E5ST,B08VL5S148,"2.0 out of 5 stars No Fastcharging, No Pairing Due to Bose Connect App Failure",scott c.,2,"Bought 2 of these after reading you could pair them for party mode and/or stereo. I had no interest in a single speaker, I already had an altec lansing for that(though the sound is inferior to these). Unfortuntely, the first thing I tried to do was use the Bose Connect App I down loaded before i even got the speakers. Followed the ""intuitive"" instructions and had no problem pairing with each speaker seperately, but to pair two speakers, either for party mode or stereo(you have to be in party mode to intiate stereo) you HAVE to use the Bose Connect App to go into party mode/stereo. It's been 2 weeks and used at least different devices, and I have only managed to get into party mode twice, SO THATS A HUGE FAIL considering the price I paid to be able to pair two speakers!!!!! It's also a HUGE FAIL on the lack of fast charging in 2023/24!!! The sound on these are good for the size, but if they are lacking the most, it's bass, so a seperate subwoofer option would be a nice addition, IF YOU COULD BUILD EQUIPMENT THAT COULD ACTUALLY PAIR WITH OTHER UNITS WITHOUT FAULTY SOFTWARE TO CONTROL IT FIRST!!!!!! Disappointed in Bose. I have owned a lot of Bose products over the years and through out most of them, Bose stood head and shoulders over most competitors with well built, well crafted, industry standard products, but it's always disappointing when a well trusted brand sells you an inferior product, whether it's material, workmanship, design, or software or all of the above. It sucks when you have 2 of the exact same speakers, but you can only listen to one at a time and the only option you have is to struggle to get the manufacturers app to actually do what it's supposed to be created for. DON'T BUY THIS SPEAKER OR ANY OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS IN THIS SERIES THAT RELY ON THE BOSE CONNECT APP IF YOU WANT TO PAIR SPEAKERS!!!!! IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

I originally ordered 1 unit, and then later that day ordered a second one. DEFINITELY get at least 2! The sound quality with 2 is what I expected from a high quality product like Bose. They are very lightweight, portable, easy to use, and can pair multiple speakers via Bluetooth for full surround sound! Seriously! Download the Bose Revolve + II Soundlink App to control them. It does the thinking for you by guiding you through the pairing and steps controlling the units. Easy peezy. I purchased the cases and flat cradle chargers too. Highly recommend all! üëçI personally like a touch more bass in my music, but these things only weigh about as much as my cell phone for Pete's Sake, so this was completely expected as the rule of thumb is: more bass = more weight, and I wasn't about to order portable speakers that had a little more bass and were going to tire me from just carrying them around everywhere. No thanks to that idea. Heh.Product approved. Very happy with my purchases and thanks to seller!","Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2022",AHXMYU76VY5PBW4TRB2ZZVZO453A,True,3,Color: Black

I think maybe i was expecting more for the price. If you want something small and compact that has a decent sound to it this is for you. Right out of the box it sounds great at low to mid volume but after that it kind of gets distorted. You can turn the bass down on your phone and it wont do that but kind of defeated the purpose of why i wanted a bose speaker in the first place. if thats what i gotta do then should've just went with JBL or some other brand. Honestly for the price i think there are better options depending on your sound preferences. I like loud with bass and clarity, a hard combination to get right yes i know but thats my preference.

It's small, easy to move around, insanely loud, and the best part is that it can be controlled with an app. Almost anything with Bluetooth connects to it (your phone, your laptop, tablet, etc.,) so you can stream whatever your favorite streaming service is right to it. If you have more than one Bose speaker, then you can set up something called ""party mode"" and have these or other Bose speakers set up around your house. I didn't need to though. I used this for a get-together, and the music was blaring and could be heard throughout my entire house.

R3ED0R4VCG7DP7,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Speaker for All Needs,Colin,5,"I was in need of a new versatile portable speaker to fit my summer adventures; one that was portable enough to fit in a beach bag and left in my car or to play out in my pool area that packed a punch in sound. After a week of owning this speaker, all in all it has checked every box.TLDR: This speaker, while a tiny bit smaller than what I was expecting, packs amazing sound quality from a trusted brand to easily liven up any outdoor occasion. Their app is great for EQ settings, however the physical ULT button provided great boost to your music by itself to hype up any outdoor event. Waterproofing is great and holds a good charge while being extremely portable with its carrying strap.Packaging:- The speaker arrived in a regular cardboard box. While it was nice to see Sony turn to the newer trend of making packaging as recyclable as possible, I did notice that the pieces holding the speaker were flimsy and could possibly be a concern during delivery. However, mine thankfully arrived in perfect condition. Included inside the box was the speaker itself with the carrying band already attached, a USB A to USB C charging cable, and a very small paper pamphlet. Instructions for the speaker are found through a scanned QR code within this pamphlet which allowed for more information about the speaker to be addressed.Sound Quality:- As to no surprise from this being from Sony, this speaker sounds amazing. It doesn‚Äôt get tinny at higher volumes, the dual drivers create amazing bass, and overall it covers all genres with no issue presenting truly enjoyable melodies for all music. At max volume, while the speaker does not get deafening loud if you are outdoors (indoors it possibly will depending on what you define as deafening lol), it certain gets loud enough to entertain a large area. In my 40 foot by 120 foot patio, this speaker shined and was the center piece of great sound quality and entertainment. While it certain suits my needs for loudness, you can always take it a notch up by either using the ULT button or pairing it with a second ULT Field 1 and working them in stereo (both discussed in features).Features:- This speaker is packed with all of the expected features of a modern Bluetooth speaker. It quickly connects to remembered devices when powered on (one nice little note: to power on/off this device, only a single press of the power button is needed for each. While a small detail, it truly is something that is appreciated for ease of use) and has a great battery life. While I cannot speak for the full I‚Äôve gone 6 hours of using the speaker which left it at 50%, so I believe their claim of 12 hours of battery life to be true. This speaker also has a quick charger feature of 10 mins of charging for 3 hours of playback. I haven‚Äôt tested that myself as of yet, but I have other newer Song products with similar fast charging features and their claims for those products have not fallen short, so I believe these ones as well.- There is also a Bluetooth pairing button, a multiple use button that can play/pause tracks, skip/reverse tracks, and answer/hang up phone calls depending on need. Functionality was clearly a forethought of this speaker, since this button‚Äôs commands‚Äîwhile certainly vast‚Äîare greatly designed. Play/pause is a single press, skip is a double press, reverse is a triple press, and it converts to a call answer/hang up button with a single press functionality when you receive a call. There are also independent volume up/down buttons which increase the volume by a decent percentage in each press.- Then there is the ULT button, which is a built in EQ adjustment presented as a physical button on the speaker. It comes with default settings when pressed that noticeably enhance the all around sound quality of any melody, with an emphasis on bass and treble. The EQ for the ULT button can be adjusted in the Sony Music Center app. It‚Äôs a great feature to use when you want to give that extra boost to your music.- While I have not tried it myself, this speaker also has the ability to be set in stereo with a second ULT speaker, and I‚Äôm sure the dual speaker combination could easily work as a stereo set up for any venue needs.- The waterproofing of this speaker is on par with expectations. I‚Äôve taken it to many water-based areas and have gotten it splashed with water and it‚Äôs been completely fine. The USB C charging port is covered with a water tight seal that you can open and close easily.- This speaker works with Sony‚Äôs music center app, and while it‚Äôs a bit rougher than their headphone app, it still works wonderfully to optimize the speaker‚Äôs functionality and performance. Full EQ settings are available, along with specific battery percentage, updates, and settings for the speaker.- The included carrying strap is a nice touch that, I will admit I did not initially think I was going to like, however it very quickly grew on me and I find myself carrying the speaker solely by the strap anywhere I take it. It is tied onto the speaker and can be removed, however you will have to re-tie it yourself if you want to reattach it.Build Quality:- Once again, as expected from this price point and the Song brand, this is truly a high quality speaker. It feels great to hold, with the fabric being sturdy and made of soft material. The buttons are covered in strong rubber that give a satisfying response when pushed. The carrying strap is thick and made of a high quality and very slightly elastic material. You are certainly getting your money‚Äôs worth on quality alone, which is what I expect from the Song brand.Final Thoughts:- While it is certainly understandable to hesitant when looking at a $120 Bluetooth speaker, this one truly is worth its value. I have very little complaints with this speaker, and think that it‚Äôs a great edition to anyone‚Äôs outdoor entertainment experience. The ULT button is a feature I find myself using more than expected (in a good way) to help boost my music during gatherings to help the entertainment. With its waterproofing, I feel comfortable using it as a travel speaker to any destination I plan on visiting. This feature packed speaker is truly one of a kind, and I‚Äôm certainly satisfied with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AHWLZPJ4HLRGSDCGXHCEWVVOGX4Q,True,17,Color: Off White

The ULT button adds a lot of bass and I love that! It is great for EDM, Hip hop, R&B, 80s, 90s,... I tried basically everything I could, and it all sounded great.

You can also change other settings and even see the battery life, which I could not believe was still 60% after a couple of days of me casually using it!

I don't know what, but it changes color, which is a nice touch. See pics.Love the Forest Grey color, it is exactly as expected. A subtle green/grey that I have gotten a lot more comments on than I ever though I would.LIFE/KID-PROOF!Ok, so I like music in the shower, and let me tell you... this thing delivers, even when it got wet it still sounded clear. I did not need to have it at full volume either.Of course, my girls heard it, and when it was bath time, they wanted to have it with them. That is when I discovered it could float!! Now it does not sound great that way, but it still played even after multiple ""accidental"" dunks in the tub! They also loved to see what they could put on the woofer part, and see it dance and fall out.Lastly it is stink proof, as well as mud, sand and waterproof... My daughters and I clean the pond behind our house, usually after big storms, and pick up plastic and other garbage we find. My 6 yo, who likes to hold the speaker as a purse, thought it would be a great idea to bring ""Ultra"" (that is what they named it) with us while we did so. As expected, it dropped into the stinky pond muck when a dragonfly landed on it, and she screamed and tossed it like a live grenade...after fishing it out, I rinsed it off with some dawn and the water hose and it was good as new.To say this has held up remarkably well is an understatement. It looks great, sounds great, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a portable speaker.

R1CMFWUKND8EM,B0CXL4FQBK,"5.0 out of 5 stars Big sound, little package!!!",Mike,5,"This little speaker surprised me. This ‚ÄúULT‚Äù button packs a punch, but not in the way you would think. Most of my past speakers with a boost button basically increased bass. It‚Äôs fine if that‚Äôs all you want, but the equalization isn‚Äôt there. The bass over-powers the voice or the other instruments. This ULT button gives you more bass - check , and the other sounds also get enhanced. It‚Äôs pretty remarkable. The strap is cool. I can hang it from the table umbrella in my back yard. Porting the side speakers was smart. You can use it horizontal like normal or when you stand it vertically, the bottom speaker isn‚Äôt fully covered. The air can go somewhere. I think Sony has a winner here. This is definitely coming pool side and beach side on our next trip to FLA. I got the white color. Looks good. I‚Äôm glad I picked this one. It‚Äôs definitely a keeper.Oh, all the other good stuff. Easy to connect to iPhone. 12 hour battery is very good for me and small for its power. Also works as a speaker phone and all the proofs.

R1SSV73W8JIH5E,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Didn't expect the sound quality coming out of this bad boy,Mike Freeman,5,"After trying out Sony Wireless Speaker, I have to say, my family and I were impressed. My teenage son has always been a hard sell on design. He was sold. The shiny Sony logo caught his attention immediately.I was surprise on the sound quality. This is me speaking from comparing to a different Sony speaker I've owned in the past (xb23 is the model number, I think).The ""cool factors"" for me were: 1. push the ULT button to enhance the bass and clear highs that really bring out the music while hanging out in the backyard. 2. Strap - It allows me to hang the speaker on the patio umbrella and out of the way of things (see pic). 3. Setting it up was a breeze. Wifey opened up the box, push the power button, paired the bluetooth, all on her own. Lastly, what really stood out to me was how well-built this speaker is. It feels sturdy and durable, but it's lightweight enough to take with me wherever I go. Plus, the sleek design looks great.Haven't had it long enough to noticed any ""cons"" about this speaker. If I were to say something, I'd say price. I purchased the speaker at regular price because I needed a second unit for our backyard. I'd like to wait for the first sale to purchase 1 or 2 more for my family members with Mother's Day and Graduation around the corner.","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2024",AFKMNV7MVRWKIXFNFEJOIYWBOUSA,True,13,Color: Off White
R2SOQ8N1C3X1JM,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Did JBL just lose?,Itryditm8,5,"The ULT field 1 is an incredible compact speaker. My Go-to was always the JBL flip series, as i right now own the flip 6.Design: The utility here is great, it has a carry strap that doubles as a hanger, or a handle!, the build is very rugged and high quality, i would not baby this thing at all, it handles its own!Sound & Performance: Out of the box the speaker comes with ULT on, and WOAH!, it gets very loud for its size!. This speaker connects to sony‚Äôs music center app, where you can customize the eq, connect in stereo to another field 1, and many other settings!. The sound is very open, clear on vocals ,it fills up a big room really well and maps the sound out. A really great sounding speaker. Battery life is really good,it varies how you use it, but real world use ( 50-80% volume, ULT on) its good for 8-10 hours straight. It does take a while to charge, about 5 hours if its completely drained. But thats good for the overall life of the battery.Compared to JBL flip 6: Ive been back forth between these two for the past couple days. And i found myself reaching for the field 1! It sounds better, its more open, it sounds like the music fills up any room, as for the JBL, it targets the sound directly at you, and the highs are a bit harsh, sony simply just outperforms it!Value: at retail ($128). I would buy this speaker no question. Its great and performs as well as speakers above its weight class.On sale : $98, i would buy it IMMEDIATELY:), insane value.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AGNZEIEKV6LTFUK2YDPG7DPE6SHQ,True,3,Color: Off White

My issue is that it only turns up a little with my phone and tablet. If I'm listening to a talk and the person has a quiet voice, I can't hear clearly. Even with the device turned all the way up and the speaker itself turned all the way up. Music sounds great from this speaker. I do like the cord the speaker has on top so it can be hung. I don't think it was worth the price I paid for it. Maybe $50, but $99 I would expect better. So far the battery life has been excellent and it was easy to set up the Bluetooth.

R1P2OVKCR03MLZ,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars New Sony drop is perfect for budget audiophiles,BB,5,"If you're on the fence, get this! I was looking for a new speaker to replace my old UE Boom that had a static tick in it (love UE, but every speaker I've had goes this route eventually).This new portable Sony speaker didn't have the thousands of reviews that more expensive (or cheaper and well-known but risker) speakers had. However, every review was positive and they were right (so far). Though I've only had this about a month, it's been a massive improvement in my home and away music setup. The sound is gorgeous. The bass is clear and deep. I'm sure audiophiles can find a $1000 speaker that will be tuned to perfection, but for music fans without those funds (and who need a trusty travel speaker) this is the one.The forest green/grey looks cool and shows off how well-made it is.Only potential con so far is that it takes a while to shut off by itself. I don't have the Sony app so maybe this is a setting you can change. It's by no means a problem, unless you are banking on it shutting itself off. The connection lasts even if your music app closes which is nice.The rope handle also makes it so you can't just slam it down; it has to be the right orientation. It's tied loosely though, so you could untie it for more position flexibility, you'd just have a longer string to carry it.I am very particular and this speaker checked all my boxes! 10/10 recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AFBXJGYWY3QZXF2IZTRJYOW3UO7A,True,0,Color: Forest Gray
RJFBE7W2A9HWL,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly Great!,Fabian,5,"What I was looking for was a compact bluetooth speaker that packs a punch in bass, so I decided to give this Sony speaker a try and boy was I surprised by it! 1. Bluetooth pairing - First, pairing this was super easy. I happen to have an Android phone and once bluetooth is on, it automatically pops up on my phone and asks if I want to pair it.2. Design - for a compact size speaker, it is really lightweight and because the speaker is shaped the way it is, it can easily stand up by itself or laid out sideways. The tether that comes with it can easily be strapped on to my backpack or a bicycle.3. Bass - The sound varies depending on the position of the speaker, but the bass is surprisingly good! The secret here is the ""ult"" button. Once you press that, it really amps up the bass while not sacrificing the clarity of the vocals. What I thought was cool was the companion app that you can use to control the speaker in which you can also customize the sound through the equalizer. I am not too picky when it comes to sound, but the opportunity to customize it will be super flexible for those who like their own sound.4. Sound Quality and Distance - This to me was the main reason why I am giving it 5 stars. The sound quality has really good range from the low tones to the high tones. I like to listen to the variety of different styles of music and I am very impressed of the sound reproduction of this speaker. Usually, I am not too far away from the speaker, but there had been times where I had to go downstairs to do something and what's nice is that the speaker had really good range for a bluetooth speaker. The sound never cut out once. As a bonus, what I discovered in the app, was an option to either turn on sound quality performance or focus on a stable connection and I think that will allow some people to really enjoy their music even from a far away distance.5. Price - $128 is still a lot of money, but for this amount of money and what I am getting from this speaker. I say it is well worth it because I can take this literally anywhere outside or inside. There have been a couple of times when my phone was paired to the speaker and somebody called in and I had a conversation with them not knowing I can actually talk to them from the speaker! So yes, if you can afford this speaker, I say give this a try! You won't be disappointed!","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AGCP3WP3ZNQM7W7TXE7ADU62LOXQ,True,15,Color: Black
RARW9ZM6Q1LZT,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Super impressive sound in a small package!,Franco F,5,"After 10 years of getting tossed around and used in the rain or humid environments, I had to retire my trusty Bose mini sound link 2. I have been looking for a replacement for some time but found most options lacking, especially in matching the Bose‚Äôs bass. However, from the first listen, these blew me away. They sound clean, can get very loud, amazing battery life but most of all they have unbelievably great bass from such a small package! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than the Bose but is actually lighter and overall build quality is excellent, with some nice details. The ULT mode is awesome and the connection is strong, even through walls or far away when outside. I love the orange but I am mindful that it is a cloth cover with semi-exposed tweeters on the ends, so I‚Äôd recommend a case or something if taking it to dirty environments or in a bag mixed with sharp things. The rubber on both sides does leave me comfortable that if this falls it won‚Äôt be any issue, plus it works well for placing vertically in tight spaces. Overall, can highly recommend and would say it‚Äôs no comparison to the UE boom, Bose sound link flex or Beats Pill I had previously tried.","Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2024",AETUKYROFNVEVSRJY2ABCK6XYUSA,True,4,Color: Orange

I honestly thing this is better compared to the JBL charge not the JBL flip, I think Sony just dropped JBL . The part that sucks is that you gotta get another Field 1 for stereo while JBL can partner up with any other JBL.You can use the custom EQ to get the Sound louder and clearer or atleast to you liking.

R294Q4QN96UURC,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Magnificent Comeback by Sony with the ULT Field 1,Lu,5,"Wow, Sony! What a magnificent comeback. This is the best-sounding speaker I've encountered at this size and price. The hourglass shape is great for palming it. Initially, I didn't think I'd like the strap, but I love how tight it is‚Äîmaking it a perfect handle. The speaker can seamlessly stand or sit facing you or directly up to disperse the sound evenly. Doing a Hz test next to one of my Charge 5‚Äôs, it easily competes. I did these tests on my mattress to better feel the vibration of each unit. The Sony produced noticeably more vibration than the Charge 5, which blew my mind. Supposedly designed to compete with the Flip 6, it's, in my opinion, better than my Charge 5. Whatever Sony‚Äôs engineers are doing, they hit a home run. The clarity is wild, the bass response is wild, and the ULT button sounds like it‚Äôs unleashing the Iron Giant, and I‚Äôm here for that. Most speakers don't appear on my ‚Äúconnected devices‚Äù widget, but this one does. After listening for the last 4 hours at about 50% volume with ULT turned on, I only lost 20% of the battery. Bluetooth connection is swift, taking about 3 seconds from pressing the power button to streaming audio from your connected device. I purchased the orange ULT Field 1. Normally, I go for neutral colors like white, gray, or black, but this orange really pops and looks sweet. It comes with a short 12‚Äù Sony-branded USB-A to USB-C charging cable. Sony, you should hook us up with 3-foot cables. Sony has truly outdone themselves with the ULT Field 1. The combination of design, performance, and features makes it a standout speaker in its category.

R2LXPDPJ7ZTXGE,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Poolside Speaker,E.J,5,"First off, I have 4 college age children so over the years we have gone through our share of portable speakers. So when Sony announced their new lineup and after reading a couple of early reviews I decided to take a chance on the new ULT1. As for the looks this ""Gator"" orange color is great. It stands out and it's exactly what I was looking for and when turning it on the first time it immediately notified my phone which made pairing simple. The design is perfect with the ""handle"" in the right spot and when I did my ""can it float test"" it righted itself every time and didn't loose a beat! As for that handle, at first it comes off a bit odd but once you realize it's dual purpose it's fairly cool. In terms of size it's about as good as it gets, as it's small enough to fit in a cup holder but big enough to feel substantial. Now for what counts. The sound quality is fantastic! As many other speakers in the same class I was expecting moderate performance but the sound was crisp, but not tin canish and the bass was great for a speaker this size. Out of the box it has the ULT boost on but you can shut it off with a touch of a button. From a durability standpoint the edges seem stout and could probably handle the inevitable drops to come! Finally as for the battery it lasted all afternoon on Mother's Day in the unforgiving Florida heat and humidity so I'd say it will do it's job on a beach day as well. All in all I'm very happy with the ULT1 and I'm looking forward to the enjoyment it will bring my family!","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2024",AE4ZT3YRO52IIPX2LKOJLEM3STMQ,True,2,Color: Orange

R1WVFAKBKYJEAQ,B0CXL4FQBK,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent affordable BT speaker - could be better.,REMY REVIEWS,4,"Just to summarize my thoughts on the ULT Field 1 quickly..Some pros:- Good quality audio- Dustproof, waterproof, etc.- SpeakerphoneSome cons:- Lacks good bass, despite it's ""ULT"" button. It's not terrible but it really seems to be hit and miss. I don't get why it varies but it's not what I expected.- Battery lifeFabric lined with silicone ends, it's fairly standard looking for a bluetooth speaker. A strap runs across the entire back which is useful for holding onto or hanging the speaker. Utilizes bluetooth, obviously, its is compatible with BT 5.3 and it supports Google Fast Pair. I didn't realize at first but you can link two units in the app for stereo playback.The control panel is a simple and intuitive layout. Power, Bluetooth pairing, play, volume up/down and ULT. The play button will also answer or end calls and it will navigate tracks.You get a cover on the back which protects the USB-C port. Charging with USB-C is great to see, by the way, and they include a USB-A to USB-C charging cable with the speaker.The speaker itself is IP67 rated which means completely dustproof and can be submerged at a depth of up to one meter for up to 30 minutes.I don't plan on using this as a speakerphone but it works well enough but you need to stay fairly close to the speaker as the signal doesn't seem particularly strong.Battery life just seems lackluster, just like the ""ULT"" bass. Sony says approximately 12 hours at volume 25 (50%) with the ULT function turned on. If you play at 100% volume, with ULT on, that drops to 3 hours. You can use the STAMINA function in the app for reduce power consumption. Speaking of battery life, and the app, when pair with your phone, you are able to see the speakers remaining battery life on your phone.Overall, it's fine. It's nothing special and even at the affordable price, I think there are better options out there from some of the big name competitors. I wasn't sure whether or not to give it 3 or 4 stars. I'd give it 3.5, if that were an option but it's not so I rounded up.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2024",AGPFBQD6BRRKEVEI3IAKXAEV4WWA,False,2,Color: Black
R3VJ6HBM3KLRK8,B0CXL4FQBK,4.0 out of 5 stars Sony ULT Field 1 Portable Bluetooth Speaker,MC,4,"First I'd like to say that this speaker has very nice appeal. It looks very nice sitting in an office, or even just on a shelf. The small design, is very well made. You can tell the difference right away when you first pick up this speaker, that it is not cheaply made (not that I would expect nothing less form Sony, or any other vendor of this caliber), and the design aspects are on point; to be beautiful and functional at the same time, with much attention to detail of the design.The thing that I wasn't impressed with is the sound. I think this speaker works well at low volumes. If you intend to listen to your music alone or in an office setting, then this may work for you, but don't engage in any high expectations from this speaker.As I mentioned earlier, if you set it on a low volume the sound is really not that bad. I would recommend turning on the ULT button, and never turning it off again for the life of the speaker. This gives it a much fuller sound at low volumes, and if you close your eyes and listen, then you just might hear a hint of bass coming through.If your mischievous, and you do decide to turn the volume up more than half way, then you wil begin to NOT enjoy the tinny sound coming from the speaker, as the clarity immediately fades away.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AFEGGRZ2KH5OZPE5ESYHC2Y4USTA,False,3,Color: Off White
R73UKTQOWQ00E,B0CXL4FQBK,"5.0 out of 5 stars Nice little speaker, great sound!",E.Swope,5,"I could say that this little speaker is surprisingly loud... but Sony is not all about loud, it is more about uality. That it has a solid build quality is more or less a given, reliability and connectivity too. The Sony Ult field 1 speaker hearkens back to their XB series. That is, it has the familiar form... and if you have seen it a lot, that is the speaker the others were imitating. Like all of Sony's portable speakers (that I am aware of) it is rated ip67 for water and dust resistance. It is pretty rugged, but don't throw it in a pool. It is not 100% waterproof. Sony doesn't play a lot of tricks to distract you from mediocre sound, because it isn't. Like few other companies which make portable blue tooth speakers, Sony does provide some audio spec... because ther3 is nothing to hide. Unlike most other portable blue tooth speakers, this small speaker has full range sound: 20 hz to 20 khz. They don't brag about their tuning. because they do not have to tweak it to cover the missing detail. All that said, the sound is rich and details. While you do not see a prominent bass boost, it is, essentially, built in (and the ult button does provide that boost, should you want it). The Field one is pretty pared down, no flashing or pulsating lights, just great sound. It may not be the loudest put there, but it is absolutely loud enough. I listened to it outdoors yesterday, and despite its' size it holds up well to open air listening. It is also very easy to use, with dedicated buttons for each function. The one surprise to me is that there are no high res blue tooth codecs, and no aux in, but then if you are using aux in it is somewhat less portable... This one is, very portable, easy to carry, easy to use, easy to listen to. I haven't found anything which does not sound good on this speaker, but that is what you get with a full range speaker. I buy a lot of Sony equipment because it is reliable in so many ways, build quality, sound quality, stable connections and up to date protocols. At the end of the day, yes this little speaker sounds louder than you would expect from its' size, but also richer, fuller and with great clarity and detail.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AGASAFHLQKQP7RNG76TKN4GPBJBQ,False,0,Color: Orange
R29M7D39J532PZ,B0CXL4FQBK,4.0 out of 5 stars Not necessarily an improvement from their past offerings,tkm,4,"I've always been a huge fan of Sony bluetooth speakers because they offered great quality, build and sound. While the Sony quality is still there, I'm not sure the sound is up-to-par with their past offerings.There's a lot of competitors in this space and what set Sony apart from them was that they really focused on making a great sounding speaker including a ""live sound"" mode, extra bass, all with having stereo drivers. Unfortunately, the stereo drivers have been abandoned so that means no more spatial live sound mode (which sounded great, BTW). The extra bass is still there, but that's there in most all of the models around this price range.Bose and JBL both mostly abandoned stereo drivers a while back but Sony still held out and I rewarded them with my purchases. Now, I don't really see much difference between a Sony, JBL and many of the other players on the market (Tribit, etc). Granted, a bluetooth speaker is typically not a critical listening device, but the Sony's of the past were borderline audiophile in their implementation. They, by far, had the best stereo implementation out of a single box bluetooth speaker. Whatever DSP magic they built into them was fantastic. That magic is, unfortunately, gone for this speaker line.The bass on the Sony is still really good though...I played a 50hz test-tone and was able to hear the tone clearly. Many so-called ""extra bass"" speakers can't even come close to playing a note that low, so the Sony still does a fantastic job in that area.The build is still good; typical of what you'd expect a Sony to be. This speaker does lack a 3.5mm input jack though (which I'm not sure why as it could have easily been put next to the USB-C port that's under a rubber cover). Bluetooth connectivity was easy. Fortunately, no ridiculous LED lights on this model so I am thankful for that. In the past Sony did give the option to turn them off or make them a solid color vs. always having them flash to the beat of the music like other brands forced upon you.I did not try TWS as I do not have two of the units. However, this would likely be the best way to listen to them as I'd love to hear a stereo image from a pair of these. My curiosity might get the best of me and if so I will update this review at that time.I'm not sure why Sony abandoned their last few generations of bluetooth speakers so quickly. Seems like just last year or so the best bluetooth speaker they've ever made IMO (the SRS-XBx3, specifically the XB43) was being cleared out for the new XG series. Now we're getting the ULT series after a short amount of time. I don't want to say that this new series sounds poor, as it certainly does not. But, it's just another mono speaker now and seems to be made for the poolside/beach party rather than listening more critically in a kitchen or bedroom. Granted, it does have a lot of low and quality bass so that mojo has not went away, but the live sound modes and dual L/R drivers disappearing is a disappointment.So as a long time Sony bluetooth speaker fan I am a bit disappointed in the direction that they've taken with the ULT lineup. They still make some of the best bluetooth speakers available, but their focus now seems to be headed in a different direction. If that direction is a pool party or other outdoor party-type of environment, this speaker will serve you very well and is certainly the quality and clear sound that you'd expect from the Sony name. If you have one of their older stereo speakers and enjoy it, hold onto that as this version will likely only be a suitable replacement if you buy two of them for TWS mode.","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2024",AGOT7D3GZFVAZMP5VJUXVODL3U2A,False,12,Color: Black

I am hopeful to sort this soon and I am sure if I contact the manufacturer I would get assistance, but eww phone calls.

R14TDMYNDRULVM,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony ULT Field 1 Bluetooth Speaker,M. Hill,5,"Featuring enhanced bass this Bluetooth speaker is compact and has noticeable weight for its size which gives it a quality feel. It arrives with a one foot long USB A to USB C charging cable and while it may be operated manually as a standard Bluetooth speaker it may also be controlled by the Sony Music Center app which to fully utilize all the features requires at least a second speaker. A small reference guide is included but a UPC code is provided on the underside of the box lid for an online version of a more detailed manual.For a Bluetooth speaker where portability is the point the sound is surprising good--clear and precise although at higher volumes reproduction is somewhat tinny. The bass boost adds depth which seems all the more necessary in an outdoor setting where acoustics are non-existent. Overall at this price point the speaker has an excellent sound and a solid build. If interested operation details follow.On arrival I plugged it into a USB A charging port during which a small orange LED light located below the power button was illuminated and when fully charged the light went out. After gently pressing the power button a small green light and a small blue light are illuminated. If familiar with Bluetooth pairing the operation is straightforward and if not information is available in the manual. Ready to listen to music I manually connected the speaker to my iPhone music library.The touch control panel at the top of the speaker includes a power, Bluetooth, play/pause, volume minus & plus along with the ULT bass boost control. A water resistant trap door at the back of speaker covers a USB C port for charging. There is a built-in omnidirectional microphone to use during phone calls. The location is not obvious but it is approximately an inch to the right of the control panel and an inch below.Battery life is stated to be 12 hours at level 25 volume which is approximately 50 percent and at full volume 3 hours. The ends on the speaker have a rubberized bumper which should offer some shock protection if dropped. The IP67 rating means it is dustproof and water resistant in up to 3 feet of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. It has a simple removable woven strap for transporting the device.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AHCFDFVAK4QZPXXF35WGU3MVFVDA,False,1,Color: Black
R1NSAHUWCH6IF5,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars The Quality You Expect from Sony,David Lowe,5,"There are a handful of names that are instantly recognizable in the world of electronics and Sony is one of them. Whatever consumer electronics you buy, whether a TV, stereo or whatever, if it has the Sony label on it, you expect it to be good. That is part of the brand.This speaker delivers the quality you'd expect from Sony. I have a number of bluetooth speakers and some are just ok. This Sony speaker has great sound and isn't too big or bulky.It has a nice rope-like handle for carrying.It connects easily via bluetooth and feels durable. The quality of the speaker seems excellent.It has a ton of extra features which I have not tested. Honestly, I don't often pair multiple speakers or use my speakers for phone calls, but it's nice to know this speaker has those features if you need them.For me, bluetooth speakers need to have good sound and be mobile, as I often take them on the go. This speaker delivers on both fronts. You can certainly pay less for a no-name speaker that gives ok sound and features. But this speaker is very reasonably priced and as I stated, with the Sony brand, you pretty much already know the quality is going to be good. It is.","Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2024",AGFIFOWHQ5ICDULACEUY5RXBYZJA,False,0,Color: Forest Gray
R3NFO7DBA3ZQJH,B0CXL4FQBK,"5.0 out of 5 stars For it's size, it sounds great. The bass does get deep.",J. Victor,5,"Only the Tribit Stormbox Flow has louder deep bass than the Sony Ult 1 in this size category. But the Flow also only has one driver, and it just doesn't sound as detailed even if you adjust the EQ using the Tribit app for more clarity. I would rather have the Sony Ult 1 as my go to small speaker for overall performance.That said, for $128 (at time of review) there are other speakers that I would direct your attention as better alternatives if you don't mind the size being bigger.The Lonzuer Action is the speaker on the left in the picture. It's not much heavier, and at time of this review it is $108.99 and gets louder with much fuller bass than the Sony Ult 1. It features a back firing speaker at the rear that when put close to a wall (but not against the wall) really helps fill up a room. It's retro look is sleek, it has bass, volume, and treble knobs on top for quick adjustment. It has louder bass than a JBL Xtreme 2.The MLove A200 is a gem. It's the off-white and gold speaker in the pic. This thing has MEGA bass. I was shocked at how good it sounds relative to it's price. It has volume, bass, and treble knobs. It gets loud but with controlled bass. It really is at the price of $90 (at time of review) a steal in terms of sound per dollar. It's my go to when I don't want to lug a bigger partybox or the Stormbox Blast around.Lastly, the DOLPHIN LX90 at $120 (at time of this review) is a real party speaker. It has tight punchy deep bass - and it should, it's a huge speaker. It's mids and highs are kind of a mess, it's not meant for critical listening. It's just big dumb fun. The A200 and the LX-90 are pretty neck and neck in terms of overall bass. But the LX90 gets loud, making it a great budget boombox.There you have it, this is a great speaker for it's size. It has a 3 band EQ in the Music Center app (instead of a 5 band for the ULT-7) But I laid out some alternatives in the price range that should be considered. They are all louder with more bass than this ULT1. I was very disappointed with the ULT7, if you are considering that monstrously overpriced thing go read my review on it.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AFY73LAG6WW5YGYHTQ2IQ75BFLRA,False,5,Color: Orange

It definitely pops and is a bit of a wow factor, so if you like more subtle colors for electronics etc. you may want to go with one of the other color options. I have several Sony speakers from the past years and this one is definitely up there with my favorites. My other favorite has lights that go to the music, this one does not include that but instead is a lot more portable which I love. Main reason for loving this speaker and Sony in general is the bass!A lot of other speakers around this price range, that are actually portable, just don‚Äôt sound good enough to me bc I don‚Äôt get enough bass. This one has a button labeled ULT which I believe means Ultimate. Well that button brings in bass or takes it away, and wow what a difference it makes turning it on! It isn‚Äôt bass that has too much vibration either, it really does completely compliment all sounds of the music playing. I also utterly love that it was sooo easy to pair to my phone! Literally turn on Bluetooth on both, and find the right speaker and pair!It does have an app you can use for all kinds of equalizer options which is great for customizing how you listen to music and being able to change things around depending on your taste! I am super content with the default settings but it‚Äôs nice to know that is an option for classical music or other unique sounds! I have not tested the waterproof level or ruggedness, and I love this speaker so much I don‚Äôt really want to get it dirty or wet!

R2F8A2V513X8TL,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Powerful small portable speaker.,Ty,5,"Sony really hit a home run with their ULT line up. Already own the 7 series. Which is loud and powerful, while delivering a warm solid bass. I wanted something smaller that I can leave in the car.This unit is about 8"" inches long and a bit bigger than 3 "" inch in diameter. The speaker came fully charged and was wrapped nicely in a white cloth bag. The only accessory that comes with is a USB Type-C cable.Upon turning on the speaker, my phone immediately recognized the speaker with an icon of the speaker. Asked me if I wanted to pair the speaker and about 1 minute later. My phone with paired with the speaker.Having own other brands and off brands. I think Sony is really stepping up their game with the portable sound system. I played a few classical music like from Mozart and Beethoven. The mids and high are nice and crisp. The bass is tight and doesn't sound muddy. At 50% this speaker really rhunpa and sounds great. There was no hint of any distortion once I turned the volume up to 80%.Also tested this speaker with some 80' old school rap/hip hop. Man, does this little speaker really put out the bass and ""juice"". It got so loud, my wife has walked into the living room and asked me to turn it down.Overall this is a rich sounding and powerful bass speaker system. It definitely will live in the vehicle when we're out relaxing somewhere outdoor. The only gripe is not sure what to do with the Paracord type it's loop from end of the speaker to the next. So I might just remove it.Also it has a IP 67 rating so it will be perfect for the outdoors when I go camping. So anyone who's looking to get a small powerful rich sounding speaker.

R222FIJ0NZCL0Z,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Great room-filling sound; bass is really solid,AZ123,5,"I've been really happy with a pair of Sony ULT Wear headphones, so I was interested in seeing if this bluetooth speaker, the ULT Field 1, would be as impressive. It turns out that it is; a really good portable speaker.One thing I liked was having a color choice. I'm getting weary of having all black devices, so being able to get an off white speaker (the same as my headphones) was a pleasure. You can also get gray or orange (orange? really?) instead of black or off white, but they didn't have the vibe I wanted. Nice to have the choice, though.Now, on to the speaker's sound. It's pretty remarkable. I wanted to give it a true test, so I first put it on the other side of the room, about twenty feet away, and let it do its thing using the ULT feature. I thought it might sound boomy, but it actually had a nicely balanced sound across a range of music genres. The sould filled the area nicely and, apart from its not having a stereo soundstage, sounded like a quality set of home speakers. I was surprised and very pleased. In shorter distances, I turned off the ULT feature and it still sounded great, without excess bass response at all.The speaker itself is a good size, too; not too large, like some of the behemoths you see these days. Still portable, and described as waterproof and dustproof, too. Very cool. Its charge time and duration are very reasonable, actually better than most bluetooth speakers I've had of about that size.So, you can see that I have nothing negative to say about this Sony product. I expect it to be my main bluetooth speaker henceforth, and plan to use it both indoors and out.

I compared the speaker to my two current favorites in size range, the Klipsch Nashville and the Bose Soundlink Flex, overall both speakers beat the Sony for sound quality. The Klipsch is something special sound wise but is quite a bit heavier in size, the Soundlink has a better out of the box sound, with EQ the Sony come very close. Ultimately the neither is a bad choice, the Sony is 20 dollars cheaper, but the Bose is frequently on sale.

I have owned this for 3 years and have taken it everywhere, never missing a beat‚Ä¶ (Yes pun)‚Ä¶The sound quality on this is pretty good out of the box but some EQ‚Äôing on the app makes this really come alive with a vibrant sound. I cannot emphasize enough how much improvement a makes for this portable speaker. For me, this really loves a V shaped EQ as the mids are pretty forward and dominant out of the box. The hardware itself is great but the tuning is pretty average out of the box. If you don‚Äôt mind dialing it in yourself, it is well worth the 5-10 minutes it takes to set it and forget it. This has a pretty wide range for such a moderately sized speaker. This speaker boasts a generous capacity for bass and has excellent sound separation. It seems to have 2 mid-range drivers, 2 high range, and one ‚Äúsub.‚Äù I initially used this as a little soundbar for my desktop pc but now it is my daily driver. I have used it nearly every day for 3 years and it has been rocksteady the whole while. The battery life is still excellent too.Back to the EQ, this benefits from a bit of extra sub bass, generous mid bass amplification and moderate upper mids and treble. With that set up, this little guy really becomes vibrant.Being a smaller speaker, the bass is obviously going to be somewhat limited but for the size it is surprisingly present. I would describe the bass as present, clean, and generally responsive.For durability I may not be the best person to ask because I‚Äôm generally pretty protective of this thing but it has been in a backpack hundreds of times and even dropped a few slight drops. Other than a small dent from one such drop there is no real sign of wear.All in all I would highly recommend this speaker for anyone who wants the best possible sound quality for the money!","Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2024",AGVTW4JTHAFPLMM6EQNFZ5XAL6IQ,True,1,Color: Black
R3I3FJYPNV3J1Z,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Great overall value. Loved it so much I added another!,Bryan A,5,"I've owned a number of Bluetooth speakers in my life and my complaint is usually the same on anything that doesn't include a high price tag. Most are muffled, lack clarity, and are particularly bad on the low end. I've read the countless reviews on the Soundcore Motion+ and finally decided to try it out. I'm very glad I did as it's by far the best smaller Bluetooth speaker for the price or less that myself or friends have enjoyed.Pros:-Sound quality is very good for what I listen to and I listen to a lot of genres of music, movies/shows, and racing.- I love the size and weight of it. It's built very well. (It might be a bit too large/heavy if you like small ultra light weight speakers)- Bluetooth connectivity has been excellent, the app works great, I really like the stock EQ settings as well as the custom EQ.- Value compared to the well known name brands is exceptional.- I love the rubber on the top and bottom of the speaker. On slippery surfaces it grips well and on the top it's a nice soft touch. The top does show fingerprints, but those are really easy to clean off. I prefer that to just plastic or cloth by far.- I've not had it out in the direct rain, but I've had it out in very high humidity conditions and have spilled water on it and it didn't affect it at all. It just made it easier to clean.- The 15 degree angle of the speaker is awesome if you're sitting down or standing up. It definitely makes a difference if you have it lower than ear level listening.Cons:-I wish it had a mute button-I wish it had a battery life indicatorNeither con is enough to deduct a star from it though. You can obviously mute it from your device or see the battery life in the app, but when I'm full screen watching something live it would be nice to easily see battery life or mute on the device itself, especially when I have it hooked up to my mini PC. On a phone or tablet that is in your hand or right next to you then it's not a big deal at all.Overall this speaker is flat out awesome. I'm very happy with my purchases and I look forward to seeing what Soundcore can come out with in the future. A larger version of this with some more low end bass would be the best of all worlds in my opinion! I just wish I wouldn't have overlooked it for so long, because it wasn't a big name speaker brand.

R1CSRVU64OQJD8,B07P39MLKH,"4.0 out of 5 stars You have questions, I have answers",TazandSteve,4,"This is going to be long winded, but I'll likely answer a lot of your questionsMy intended purpose was to replace an aging Bose SoundLink Mini 1 that I was using for music in my garage gym. The SoundLink mini is an impressive speaker when it's size is taken into account. They provide a deep, full sound and produce great bass, but struggle when turned up much past 60% (at least mine does, but it is old). What I wanted was a speaker that could get louder while still producing a quality sound. I found that in the Motion+.When I first unboxed it, I noticed that it is heavy and has a very solid build. It is, however, it's not beautiful. The rubberized outside feels good and feels like quality and there are two rubber feet on the bottom to keep it in place.When first powered up you are greeted with the power up and pairing tones. They are honestly less annoying than others I have heard, though I know of no way to disable them.Pairing was VERY fast and straightforward and I can get a good distance away (I didn't measure though) without hiccups.It comes out of the box with Bass Up mode enabled. Listen... Bass Up mode sucks. It honestly should be called Treble Down mode. Yes it increases the bass, but not as much as you can in the custom EQ.I played a few songs in Bass Up mode just to see what I heard and as stated above, did NOT like it. I then played with the provided EQ settings in the app. I think if you are going to choose a canned EQ setting from the Soundcore app, the ""heavy"" one is decent. After that I played with the ""custom"" EQ settings and the speaker really started to come to life.Once you settle on an EQ setting you like, the SPEAKER retains those settings. So even if you pair it with a different device it will still play with your EQ settings.Now, I also have a built in EQ on my OnePlus 6T and decided to try that. First I turned off the custom EQ settings on the speaker (best way to do that is to hit the BassUp button on the speaker twice. Once turns on the BassUp profile and a second one turns BassUp off, reverting to ""bassoff"" mode). My OnePlus EQ has some ""general enhancements"" setting that I applied and I played with the sliders and it sounded pretty awesome. Then, I applied my custom Soundcore app's EQ on top of that and WOW! One EQ was awesome and two were even better.My next major test will be to try the speaker from different sources. I have access to a couple Samsung S9s, some android tablets, etc. I don't own any iPhones so I can't test that out. I'll update my review after doing more testing.I played with it for a few hours yesterday and even played it a bit in my car on the way to work this morning. I did find that the sound actually seemed to change slightly after playing a while. I don't know if speaker break-in is real or not, but I believe that the bass has become fuller and warmer after a few hours use. I'll update on this aspect as well.I am eclectic when it comes to music so I'll give a quick rundown of the types I've tried and what I thought.- Country music: I played several Chris Stapleton songs and I felt this showcased the speaker the absolute best. All the instrumentation came through warm and clear.- Heavy Metal: This is a WIDE genre and will likely be what is most often played on this speaker (it's for my gym, remember?). I found that ""industrial metal"" (Rammstein, NIN, etc.) needed a little massaging in the EQ to separate sounds better, but sounded great afterward. I ended up leaving these minor adjustments in place because they helped all the other music too. Atreyu, FFDP, Volbeat, etc all sounded powerful, loud and full.- Rap: Honestly, on day one I was ready to say that this speaker just sucks for beat driven hip hop music. However, after playing with the settings and letting it ""break in"" (if that's a thing) I was wrong. For example, I recently played ""come and see me"" by Ludacris which relies heavily on a bass line that varries from low, to really low with some thumps thrown in. I could hear all the deep frequencies, the slightly higher bass tones, and the periodic thumps moved my speaker. After that I threw on UGK's ""Gravy"" which also relies heavily on bass and it sounded fantastic.Now, how about that bass, since that's why most of you are here. This speaker is able to play really low frequencies, but it will NOT ""hit you in your chest"". You will hear all the bass, but you wont feel the bass... why? Because it's a freaking portable bluetooth speaker, not your home theater system, your bookshelf system, or your car stereo. If you want to FEEL the bass in your chest or whatever, you'll need to pony up for a speaker with enough size to resonate those sound waves. Doing so, you'll likely lose a lot in portability and whatnot. However, I have heard that the ""w-king D8"" is a good bass head speaker. Check out some YouTube reviews (or just order it, it's super cheap).Another thing to note is that the high frequencies are capable of getting louder than the low frequencies. As you crank this up, the bass will reach a point where there just isn't enough room inside the enclosure. People say you ""lose bass"" as you increase volume, but you don't, you just stop increasing bass at a certain point while the treble keeps on going. I've ran mine at somewhere near 90% volume and I can tell you that the drivers are still increasing their work, because the speaker basically starts having as seizure. It's just that there isn't any more space inside to resonate the waves.The reason, and the ONLY reason this isn't getting a full five stars from me is that my speaker farts. Yes... you read that right but only when cranked to uncomfortable levels and bass heavy music. There are a couple possible reasons for this. I could be asking for the passive radiators to do too much (I have two EQs, after all). It could just be the way it's designed (although I have read a TON of reviews on here and Reddit and never seen anyone mention this). Or my unit is defective somehow. Think about that last one though. If I DO have a defective unit, and my review is still this good, what does that tell you?I will reach out to Anker/Soundcore support just to ask some questions because their support is amazing. I've had other products from them and they provide the absolute best support I've ever received.To end (for now), this speaker really should be an automatic buy if you are looking for a portable BT speaker with high end sound under $100. If you are looking for ""slap you in the lungs"" bass, get something LARGER. I don't care what brand it is you can't get more real bass out of a package this size... physics is physics.","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2020",AHWVSZSTGXPDVPTOWARPP5H5QPQA,True,188,Color: Black

I listen to most types of music with the exception of rap. Classical music with its many layers is where this speaker shines. It is easy to hear all the instruments with nothing being muffled. The unit charges quickly and lasts for at least eight hours. Fits nicely on a desk top. I mostly use it when sewing, and working out.

R19XDNHSZB3ZH1,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars The Audiophiles Choice,Russell B.,5,"The Soundcore Motion+ is an elegant design with excellent ergonomics that elevates this speaker above & beyond. It feels substantial in your hand and well built. The volume controls located on the top of the speaker are perfectly centered between the bass drivers on either side, and the front passive radiator which allows for easy navigation. Technically, the Motion+ excels with an AKM DSP featuring active crossovers for its four amps, each with its own dedicated power supply, silk dome tweeters (which I believe are Scan-Speak design), bass drivers with large neodymium magnets coupled to two passive radiators and USB-C charging. It‚Äôs a brilliant design that is supremely executed. Hats off to the sound engineers that collaborated on this speaker! Once you‚Äôve unboxed and charged your Motion+ you‚Äôll want to update the firmware and set up the custom EQ. To do that you‚Äôll have to download the app. To use Ankers Soundcore App, you‚Äôll have to accept giving up a huge amount of personal data analytics, so I chose to install the app on a tablet. Just beware. The Soundcore Motion+ will save your custom eq setting, however, you‚Äôll want to delete the Soundcore app and re download it to verify that the settings are correct. The app will lower the sliders if they‚Äôre in between whole dB‚Äôs. Once it‚Äôs dialed in, you shouldn‚Äôt have to open the Soundcore app again. You'll want to refrain from pushing the bass up button on the top left of the speaker, since that bumps you off your Custom eq setting. The only way to get back to your saved eq preset is from the Soundcore app. I set the 9 bands of equalization all below flat to give the digital amplifiers extra headroom, keeping any audible distortion at bay. See attached photo. Since this speaker isn‚Äôt a three way and audible distortion is most prevalent at 1kHz, I set that band to -5 dB. Next is the lower and higher mid ranges at 700 Hz and 5kHz which I set to -4dB. 500Hz and 8kHz are at -3dB while 300Hz and 12kHz are at -2dB. Lastly, keeping the bass strong, I‚Äôve set 80 & 150Hz at -1dB. So how does it sound? It‚Äôs airy and open projecting a surprisingly effective stereo image thanks to its silk dome tweeters mounted at the outside corners and tilted at a 15* angle. It‚Äôs balanced and capable with all genres of music from EDM to jazz, reggae to heavy metal. Horns, piano and vocals are beautifully rendered by the tweeters, juxtaposed by the bass capabilities of this speakers dual passive radiators. On Spotify, Amazon and Apple Music under shared playlists is my favorite titled:Epic House-Dance Music 4 The Soul.Some stand out tracks from Epic House-Dance Music 4 The Soul that sound fantastic on the Motion+ are:‚ÄúAngels (Feat. Nora Jones) Thievery Corporation Remix‚Äù Wax Poetic- Norah‚Äôs voice floats around the room, amazing stereo separation. ‚ÄúLips Like Sugar (Way Out West Remix Edit)-Echo & The Bunnymen- Punchy drums combined with some killer bass lines and melodic synth combined with sexy lyrics and a memorable rhythm guitar, this track sounds great blasted all the way! ‚ÄúRadiation Ruling the Nation(Protection)- Massive Attack. Even at max the on purpose distortion in this track sounds so authoritative! ‚ÄúI Want You (John Morales M+M Main Mix)-Marvin Gaye. This 9:36 long Masterpiece, highlighted by bongos, piano and saxophone are easily distinguished in the mix, throw in Marvin‚Äôs amazing tone, and man is this song better than the original? I think so. An analog 3.5mm jack is provided for those times when Bluetooth is not an option, however sound quality is best when left in the digital domain given the Motion+‚Äôs DSP. Speaker placement is important for the Soundcore Motion+ to sound it‚Äôs best. A solid surface such as a granite counter top, placed near a back wall, or corner placement can help accentuate the low end punch of the Motion+. A helpful hint is to hover the speaker in whatever area you‚Äôve chosen and place the speaker when the bass moves your hand the most. Placing the speaker just inches one way or another can have a dramatic effect! This speaker excels indoors in moderate sized rooms, and can sometimes struggle in larger rooms or when played outside. The Motion+ puts out some serious SPL‚Äôs for such a small device. Have The Motion+‚Äôs USB-C plugged into power along with using the speakers volume control not the source device when you‚Äôre seeking the loudest output. The longer I live with this speaker the more I appreciate it. It‚Äôs an attractive design that‚Äôs understated yet compelling. For example, the power button glows white while powered on and changes to a blinking red when the speaker is running out of juice. In this state it automatically plays at a reduced volume until plugged in. Once plugged in to a charger via the USB-C port, the Motion+ increases in volume and continues to play while charging. Nice touch! I purchased a second Motion+ and my observations are that something magical happens with this speaker between the 3rd and 4th charging cycle. Keep that in mind when listening to yours. Critical listening should happen after the Motion+ is played for 30+ hours. In regards to Bluetooth connectivity, I highly recommend having a dedicated music source other than your phone. That awesome playlist playing from your phone while your phone is blowing up? It‚Äôll be paused by the speaker from all the notifications.I modded mine, see photo, by super glueing a convex item over the bass up button, ensuring my speaker will always sound good! :-)The Soundcore Motion+ is a technical marvel of inspired engineering. I am consistently blown away by its performance. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2019",AF67AQ42X5P3EYLUS6XXSDRTBORQ,True,162,Color: Black
R2QOAJU0QZKQ4P,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Such a beautiful speaker that sounds really amazing; especially for it's size!!!,thegrudge,5,"This is such a beautiful speaker that sounds really amazing; especially for it's size!!! I haven't updated the firmware on any of the 3 Motion Pluses that I bought or downloaded the app yet; so my review is what I think of them straight out of the box. Anyway, when I first spotted these things on Amazon, I just knew that I had to have one (and then 2 more after I got 1 of them).Pros:1) Really really great sound out of these things even with the BassUp feature ""OFF"".2) For larger rooms turning ""ON"" the BassUp features helps just enough with the bass in larger rooms without bogging down the sound.3) Tight punchy bass with or without the BassUp feature ""ON"".4) Mids & highs sound fantastic, very clear with great instrument separation.5) Pairing 2 speakers together makes these sound even better for increased stereo separation and fullness of sound‚Äîand the BassUp feature isn't needed as much when using 2 speakers.6) Beautiful design, it's the best looking speaker that Anker has made to date, in my opinion.7) IPX7 rated...so it's completely waterproof.8) USB-C charging and cable (I think that the first charging time on one of mine was about 3.5 hours but charge faster with a better socket adapter, or so I hear).9) Still has an 3.5mm stereo auxiliary jack and supplied cable.10) Battery level indicator shows up on my iPod even without Soundcore Motion application installed.11) Decent battery life (12 hours) however, one of mine, so far (haven't tested the others yet), has exceeded the 12 hour mark. I listen to it just below half volume and this is usually enough volume for me.12) This speaker sounds better and is louder than the Soundcore Pro (the most comparable equivalent to this speaker).13) You can turn the BassUp feature ""ON"" and ""OFF"" with this Motion Plus speaker but you can't do that with the Soundcore Pro.14) There is an application download for this speaker that I hear has some nice features on it but you can still pair it up with another speaker to get a right & left channel stereo paring without the app.‚Äîtotally unlike the JBL flip 4s and JBLs which require their app to get their pair speakers out of ""Party Mode"".15) It's a little wider physically than the Soundcore Pro and the Boost so the stereo separation is still a little better than other models, even without having to pair it to another speaker,POTENTIAL cons but ONLY if these things are important to you (they are usually NOT a problem for me):1) Although, it has good battery life the Soundcore Pro (another Anker model) has an 8000 milliamp battery (18 hours of battery life) and this one is only a 6700 milliamp battery. It might have been nice to get a little bit of a bigger battery in the Motion but it's not that disappointing to me that we didn't.2) The Soundcore Pro has a standard USB port so you can charge your phone from the speaker. (This is not important to me as I would rather just carry an extra Anker battery charging bank to charge my phone rather than use the speaker's battery.)3) It doesn't have quite as much bass as the Soundcore Pro‚Äîif you're primarily into really heavy bass, which I am NOT. This is NOT a con for me personally because I think that the Motion Plus has the perfect amount of bass with or without the BassUp turned ""ON"". I found that I always needed to EQ down the bass on the Soundcore Pro to get it where I personally liked it. I don't have to do that with this speaker.4) This speaker is larger or wider than the Soundcore Pro and the Boost; so if you're looking for something really small, this speaker might not be quite as easy to carry around as the Boost or Pro. (This is not a problem for me at all though; I actually like this feature a lot.)5) No multi light battery indicator on the actual speaker itself‚Äîbut the power button does start flashing red when batteries are getting low. (It would have been nice to have battery level lights on the speaker but I am still okay with it showing up just on the iPod and/or on the application.)6) Has sizable quantized volume increases for every click of the volume button however, these increases are NOT nearly as bad as the larger jumps in volume on the Soundcore Pro.Only 3 of these potential cons represented any problem for me:* the battery play time* no battery level indicator lights on speaker* the sizable volume increasesHowever, these issues still haven't seemed to have been that big of a deal so far because I get more than the expected battery time because the speaker is loud enough so I can just listen to it at lower volumes and get longer battery life that way. Also, I can track battery levels on my device and/or application so this isn't much of an issue with me. And as far as the sizable volume increase, I seem to be able to micro adjust them when using my finger along the slider (at least with the newer iPods and iPhones, older ones seem a bit more jumpy).Anyway, this is a really great speaker and I highly recommend it!!!NOTE: If you like your mids and highs scaled back some, then I would highly recommend the Soundcore Boost and if you really like a lot of bass with a dip in the mids, I would then recommend the Soundcore Pro. All 3 of these are good speakers though.","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2020",AGZ5Q5UNZ5WCHTCT5TX3DWABJIMQ,True,23,Color: Black
RSATCQM413XZR,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars BT connection problem : But GREAT CUSTOEMR SERVICE & Problem Solved,Alex Y. Yoon,5,"UPDATE : 10/21/2020Problem Solved. Anker/Soundcore has contacted me and they have resolved the problem for me.A great company and products. As long as there is a good customer service and they can guaranty their products, I can buy their products without worries. Thanks AnkerUPDATE : 10/11/2020I have been using this for few days. Initially, I have connected to my 3 devices. my laptop, amazon fire and my cell phone. supposedly, when I turn on soundcore, it should be automatically connect to the previous device. That it does. however, the main problem is that while playing, the music gets cut off, trying to connect to my other two devices. So basically, either I have to turn off my two other device bluetooth features or keep reconnecting the main device which is my laptop to listen to music.I have many other Anker/soundcore bluetooth speakers but none of them has this sort of problem, except this Motion + which is very strange to me.so, I have to return the product and lower the stars from 5 to 1 stars.other complain is the bass. I am not a bass head, but surprisingly it does lack a lot of bass compared to my previous speakers, Earfun. Mid and high are pretty good, but bass is still bit weak.lastly, battery life does not come close to what it advertises. about 30% less than what it advertises.bit of disappointment.===============================================I always have been a big fan of Anker for many years. I believe that I have bought at least 50 products from them since five years ago. Before this purchase, I had Earfun bluetooth speakers. I bought two of them to use as stereo home system. They worked great and sounded even better.....for about two weeks and a half. then, one of them went kaputt. No power, no charging, just simply dead without any reason whatsoever.so, I had to look for another one.I always had my eyes on this Soundcore Motion + because of a lot of good reviews in youtube and I normally trust their quality and customer service.Fortunately, this one was on deal of the day at $69.99 So I picked it up right away.Just by the weight, it is heavy and I could tell that this has a lot of battery to play for a long time and it just felt good in my hand. Everything looked substantial and fit & finish was top notch.As for the sound quality, Yes, it is good. very refined high and clear mid/vocal along with decent bass. (but bit weak compared to mid/high)However, what made me to give 5 stars was the soundcore app. I was able to control the frequencies with my phone soundcore app. That was a huge point because not all music can be played at same frequency setting.However, I don't think that this motion + can produce 30 watts as advertised. it seems a lot low.....but it is okay. Loud enough.I know that it is the first day and normally I always am eager to put my review on Amazon. Just like the Earfun, perhaps in a week or two, it might go bad. If so, then I will update my review. But my initial impression is very impressive.Thanks Soundcore.","Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2020",AGGIR5S4YQMG4IKWU3A7K3BQ56ZA,True,4,Color: Black
RNUN8GDHN4LUE,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars High-Res is a Gimmick. SBC only on Shield 2019 Pro. better raw than Sony SRS-XB32 though,SpeedingCheetah,4,"Don't fall for the label of ""High-Res Audio"" that many brands are putting on their speakers or headphones. At least Sony has grounds to say so kinda, as they support LDAC codec which is far better quality and resolution than even AptX.(LDAC 32bit/96kHz/990kbps vs AptX 16bit/48kHz/352kbps). And I don't think they mean High-Res for the AUX jack, as that audio is processed by the source DAC, not the speaker. This Anker does have AptX, but not the actual ""High-Res"" version AptX HD. (AptX has been around since BT early days btw. Since the very early 90's and AptX HD was out in 2009....and yet, u rarely see them on BT speakers despite their proven superior audio quality.I can get this speaker to connect to my Pixel 3 via AptX and it does sound surprisingly good for its size.It will only pair via SBC on my 2019 Nvidia Shield Pro. (SBC 16bit/44.1kHz/328kbps max)I tried a Sony SRS-XB32. That paired and used LDAC fine. However, it would have dropouts and pops every 30 sec or so.I have 2 sets of different Sony headphones, they use LDAC with no drop outs at all, but a Fiio BTR3 with LDAC that does cut out.I guess Shield is is picky.My main use for this speaker, is to replace a 10yr old Bose Soundlink 1 Bluetooth 2.0 speaker.I read this is a BT 5.0 speaker, and my 3 BT devices, the Shield, laptop and Pixel 3 are the same.I use this for my laptop(via Aux mostly) and recently my new Shield for late night TV watching when my large sound system is disruptive to my apartment neighbors or asleep roomates.Having 2 BT devices paired to this speaker at once(my laptop via BT and my Shield for example), when ever one devices makes a sound, the speaker will go silent for about 3 secs, then play the other source. It auto switching back to the other device it seems is harder for it as it pauses for much longer, 6 secs or so. Most of the time, i have to pause, or restart playback on the previous device to get sound to play. It is a little bit more gracefull when switching from the AUX source and the BT, but it still is a bit of a pause and fade in/out for a few secs. Best to mute or just disconnect the other source, to avoid your main source being interrupted constantly.The Bass Up default sound profile, is a tad muddy sounding, but had good sounding lows, for a speaker of this size. Turning it off, makes it sound too cheap and flat though. At least one can use the Smartphone app, (if you pair it to your phone) to use other profiles or a custom EQ. I am still playing with the EQ.Overall sound, i would say lacks some clarity and definition from the Bose Soundlink 1, but it has far better lows. Was hoping the ""tweeters"" this Anker has would be closest to the Bose, not quite it seems. (Bose does make very good products, but are overpriced. But i got the Soundlink speaker years ago at a Goodwill for $5...sooo....)Compare to the Sony SRS-XB32, which is a more expensive speaker, this Anker has better raw sound to me. Overall more clarity, definition, and more separation.Bass is tad deeper sounding up close, the Sony has a different design and seemed to output the deeper lows more front wise and could be heard better further away in that aspect. When using LDAC however, the Sony shines, despite the difference in no tweeters and different drivers. The Sony, however, only supports SBC and LDAC for some reason, so if i wanted to use my laptop via BT, it uses SBC. (The Sony also, if u have a AUX cable plugged in , it is locked to AUX mode, can't use BT unless you unplug cable...make it not usable for me.)Using the EQ in the Anker Sound core app, to make it more my taste, I really do like the sound this speaker produces, however, doing so, I can very much hear the poor quality and compression of SBC codec when playing music vids from my Emby Media Server from my Shield. Source audio files are FLAC or WAV. It really too bad this thing wont pair using AptX. Using my phone and AptX, it is much better sound. Laptop also will connect via AptX and sounds great too, but not as great as when using AUX of course, but, good enough that i may decide to ditch my Creative USB sound card that is eating up one of the 2 usb ports on the laptop.The USB C jack on this Anker is welcome, coming from a AC to DC adapter Barrel plug to charge.The top buttons are pretty much invisible on this thing. They blend in to much and are quite small, hard to find by feel alone as well.The power button on the side has a LED in it, so that is easy to find, but i would prefer power on the top along with the other buttons.Gotta give this speaker a bit more time to get adjusted to.It had a 15% off coupon sale when i purchased it here, so it makes it even more worth the lower cost than the Sony...but, it still is a disappointment for use as I mainly wanted with my Shield with AptX.EDIT: After a week of using this speaker, discovered some more quirks.The speaker does NOT remember the volume settings after you or it auto shuts off.This is especially annoying for use of AUX, as the volume is way to low and u have to press the Vol up button several times each time the speaker is powered up.The EQ you set in the app, does not function when using AUX.There is NO low battery notification at all. Only the power button LED blink red when u try to turn it on, then it turns off. No way to know the battery status while in use or at power up. (the Sony speaker had an option to announce battery level at each power on and, by default, had verbal battery low notifications on the speaker, several before it finally would die.) So unless you have this paired to a supported phone at all times and monitor via the app the battery charge, you have no idea on battery level. (those BT battery level in the phones OS is often very delayed and inaccurate in my experience with other battery powered BT devices)Battery life could be better for a speaker this size and weight. I have a much smaller Soundcore 2, and that is years old and lasts hours longer than this speaker. (Not a big deal for me, as I can just leave this speaker plugged into usb power from my hub most of the time.)","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2020",AH7QQTSSML3TTGZK3PRZLC454YTA,True,54,Color: Black
R3I7YEMYIPDPT3,B07P39MLKH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Speaker, has some fixable issues",CheezyWeezle,4,"The speaker itself is very good, has a lot of power for the size and I can usually crank it up to 100% without any clipping and almost no distortion if any at all (after adjusting the EQ settings... more on that later). The layout of the drivers and the fact that there are 5 of them in this tiny package absolutely fills the sound stage and the DSP does a very good job of balancing the power between them all. The battery lasts quite a while: long enough for a day trip or party multiple times over, and it doesn't seem to lose much charge when unused for a few days at a time. The portability is fine, it is a bit heavy and decently large, so you won't be putting it in your pocket and can't really comfortably hold it in your hands for more than a few minutes, but that's probably not what you would be buying a speaker like this for anyways.That said, I do have a few issues, some of which are major and should be extremely easy to fix (and I honestly am surprised that anyone in this day and age would leave these features out), these issues being that 1. Every time you turn on the speaker, it defaults to it's god awful ""Bass Up"" aka ""Destroy the sound quality"" EQ that makes everything sound TERRIBLE. When I first got this speaker, turned it on, and played something, I heard the awful cacophony and immediately turned the speaker off and put it back in the box, ready to return it. Then I remembered I read a review that said the default EQ was awful and that the app allows you to change it, and changing it to anything other than the ""Bass Up"" or ""Bass Off"" (Bass off sounds like the awful cacophony but without any bass) makes this speaker absolutely shine. The problem with this solution? You HAVE to have it connected to your phone, and you HAVE to use the app to change the EQ, EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU TURN ON THE SPEAKER. On the speaker itself, you can switch between ""Bass Up"" and ""Bass Off"", but you cannot set a default EQ, you cannot save a custom EQ from the 9-band custom EQ, and you cannot disable the ""Bass Up"" from being defaulted on every time you turn on the speaker. Because the speaker sounds so awful out of the box, I have given 4 stars in the ""Sound Quality"" feature, but if you change the EQ the sound quality goes up to 5 stars for sure.Another rather large issue is that it is currently impossible to use the speaker over Bluetooth with Windows 10. The device will only show up as ""Unknown device"" if it even shows up at all, and if you manage to connect to it, it will indeed name itself to Soundcore Motion+ but it does not recognize it as an audio device and you cannot use it to play sounds through. For me, this isn't a huge deal because I use the aux input when using the speaker with my computer, but I can image that this issue would impact others rather significantly.The other issues I have had are rather minor. For example, if you have the Volume Sync bluetooth feature enabled, you can only change the volume in it's predefined steps, so if one notch is too quiet, and the next notch up is too loud, you just have to deal with it and choose quiet or loud (If you disable Volume Sync, you can granularly change the volume through the Soundcore app, but then the speaker volume is independent of your device volume). Another one is that I feel that the rubber stopper that covers the ports has a rather clunky design, and while I appreciate that it is rather large to accommodate the waterproof feature, I feel like it sticks out quite a lot and gets in the way if you want to use an aux or charge it while you are using it. Also, I had a very bad experience with the firmware update, as it apparently must have at least 50% battery remaining (remember, it has a rather beefy battery and absolutely did not come anywhere near needing 50% battery, I'd say 15-20% is a more realistic limit) and also apparently takes an exorbitantly long time to update the firmware (about 15 minutes to install, I had already downloaded the measly 36MB update before it would have made a difference) while neglecting to tell you that it is going to take that long until AFTER you have already starting the update and cannot cancel it without risking bricking the thing. If I had any warning that it was going to take more than a minute, I would have waited until later so I could have used it during my break at work, instead of waiting for it to update.Now to round it off with a few more good things about the device: it turns on quickly and automatically connects to my phone instantly. It takes about 3 seconds to turn on and another second or two to connect via bluetooth. It also does NOT play any sort of sound when changing or maxing out the volume, a feature I absolutely despise in other speakers. You can also charge the speaker while using it. The Bluetooth 5.0 features are quite nice as well. The build quality is fantastic; it feels extremely solid and looks like it could take a beating.TL;DR: The speaker is great, sounds great, and has great battery life, but it has a few caveats in the feature functionality, such as poor EQ out of the box and a bug causing incompatibility with bluetooth connection to Windows 10.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2020",AFUPIW4BXLOBZXBG7CEP235UWBFA,True,13,Color: Black
R104NRVAJCWY4K,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Inexpensive and Good Sound,DG,5,"I use this for computer and play from tablet while working. This is not a name brand like Bose, Bowers or Sonos. I have those as well. But a better value. The reasons are below after using for a while.1. Unlike others the multiple drivers produce stereo sound. The expensive brands BT speakers will tell you that it doesn't matter when two speakers are in close proximity. But if you are on a desk where the speaker is located, you will hear the clear difference a stereo speaker makes. You do not need to take the hassle of pairing in TWS fashion.2. Produces clean sound. I am not an audiophile but have decent ears being a former musician. Even the newer products from the company are falling for market gimmicks to attract customers. This is a slightly older model but still better. May be you get BT 5.0 instead of 5.3. I could care less.3. You can adjust the sound profile through the app.For the things I didn't like -- the USB and Aux input had a heavy rubberized cover that was unpleasant to move for charging and input. It is there for weather protection I get that. I cut it off to keep the ports open. It stays on my desk, not shower.

And I would have only paid around $30ish if I knew how it really sounds before I bought it.

I listened to some old school Death Row records Gang Related sound track, some Warren G Regulate, some DPG Dog Food and some and Daz Dillingers Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back (these albums are VERY bass heavy) and it surprised me on how good it handled the heavy bass.

Why? The 2cent answer is because a piece of complex music requires reproduction of almost the entire frequency spectrum at the same time (think ALL the instruments at the same time), so that when a speaker‚Äôs suspension is moving to reproduce bass frequencies, it ALSO has to reproduce audio from a smaller wave at the center of the speaker‚Ä¶ sound waves then crash into each other all over the place and this is called DISTORTION‚Ä¶The question is, does this one?

R6RXRMP7F42X6,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars As of 7/22, the best $100 speaker on the market!",Joey Kot,5,"TL version:great sound with the companion app to balance the speakers EQ and take advantage of its balanced drivers.$100 is an absolute steal for the size (just short of the keys section of your keyboard) and sound with great dispersion, sound stage and bass impact [with the EQ tweeked]Excellent for a cheap sound bar solution as the voice clarity rivals my center channel speaker, absolutely shocking me tbh.First let me say i own an absurd amount of bluetooth speakers, everything from $20 pharmacy brands to the mega-sounding Aiwa Exos9. So when I saw anker get into the speaker game a few years back i figured it wouldn't be great - but not bad either. For the most part the soundcore line has been that, but has made considerable improvements over the years. some, like the soundcore 2 to 3 jump was not. the motion boom to motion boom +: Very much. I held off on the motion+ (this model) for a while and ended up getting it on prime day super cheap. While my wife wasn't happy to see another speaker sitting around... i sure am.Without seeming too full of myself, lets just say at 40 my hearing is well above that of a normal teenager let alone anyone my age. Because of this I've wedged my way into testing groups and other audio testing, my electrical engineering degree doesn't hurt either.. now on to the motion plus:its a unique size to be honest, its larger than what the price range would indicate, bigger than a bosemini for instance, smaller than an aiwa exos 3 but carries a price tag of $100-$120 USD which puts it into a questionable scenario based on suspicion alone. it has a weight that makes it feel well built, and a coating that to me says it doesnt. The coating is this rubberish coating that over time does wear out and become smooth (ala the soundcore 2 has), but its not a turn off. i don't expect an aluminum finish for these acoustics or price. The buttons are standard it seems on all soundcore speakers, up/down, bluetooth/tws, multi B button. this speaker also sports a Bass-UP button that i suggest you never use. it resets the EQ sound profiled to Bass-up and pressing the button again resets it to original. as features go, would be nice to see a scrolling EQ when this is pressed even if there is no visual aide to indicate where youre at. nitpicking folks, at its finest! Sound wise this thing shines. its frequency range is top to bottom for anyone to hear, and the soundstage disperses sound in leveled sweet spots from about 3 feet on a desk, about 12 feet out you start to loose the distinction but not the sound. this is above average for this sided speaker and i found myself using it more in situations where a smaller speaker wouldn't work. During my tests battery life was on par to what is listed as 12 hours, although like with all speakers the type and level of listening matters. I'm tempted to buy another and line them up next to my mid-sized go to pick, Aiwa's Exos 3... even though that device is larger slightly theres considerable comparisons. what might set the motion+ apart is its forward firing sub driver and open air port in the back, which puzzles me as to how it has a reflex port in the rear AND an ipx7 rating. you can bet im going to take this apart soon to find out... just as soon as i take a break from enjoying the sound of this thing during work. final conclusion is pretty straight forward, the negatives are few with the battery life being maybe, maybe a stretch the only down fall of this speaker. simply put, you will not find a speaker at one hundred dollars to replicate this sound. period. probably ever.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2022",AEU4QM6M252IYJLVIARY3YHJ3KHA,True,28,Color: Black
R2XJD2H0R604QM,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars This speaker won, out of many - I LOVE this speaker",Michael C.,5,"As you can see from the attached pictures, I tested a good number of speakers. I was in search of a speaker around $100 or less that sounded good and would fit in a suitcase for airplane travel, and used indoors in hotel rooms and cruise ship cabins. I didn't closely check dimensions and mistakenly bought a few that turned out to be too large for that purpose. I was also targeting speakers with aux inputs and power bank capabilities so I would be able to use and simultaneously charge an aptX LL bluetooth receiver. This speaker didn't have the power bank functionality, but as it turns out, I don't need it (explained below).I have a choosy ear, and once equalized with the Soundcore app this Motion+ speaker sounded better at medium to low volumes than all of the others, including the Soundcore Motion Boom, and even the larger speakers you see in the pics. The sound out of the box was not great. The app's equalizer presets were not great either. I had to do a custom EQ to get the sound the way I liked it. The beauty with these Soundcore products is that the equalizer settings stay with the speaker. They are not specific to your phone. My only complaint with the app is that you cannot save multiple custom equalizer presets with the Motion+ like you can when using the app with the Motion Boom. Why the interfaces need to be different between the two speakers is beyond me.I do believe I noticed a difference with the aptX HD Audio. I could enable/disable that option in the phone's Bluetooth setting. With it on I can hear a little bit more fidelity. Of course, MP3s and streaming audio are not great sources for testing this sort of thing. I still heard a positive difference.HUGE BONUS (for me) that I didn't know about and don't see advertised anywhere on the product page. This thing supports aptX LL (low latency)! That must just come with the other Qualcomm aptX stuff. I use aptX LL to extend my whole home audio system to ""dumb"" speakers. I had purchased a tiny aptX LL receiver to plug into this speaker via the aux input, but now I don't need it!The Motion Boom was a close second, sounding better than the rest (once equalized) but losing to the Motion+ for my use case. The Motion Boom could get a little lower, and likely louder (not tested), but the Motion+ was punchier and had a better sounding low-end overall (once equalized). I'd say the Motion Boom is probably better for outdoor, high-volume listening. I already have a larger, less portable outdoor speaker that I'm happy with, so I returned the Motion Boom. I was disappointed that the Motion Boom didn't have an aux input, and I thought the soundstage was rather narrow with the treble changing pretty drastically as you walk past the front of the speaker. If I needed an outdoor speaker I'd definitely be trying out the Motion Boom Plus.I can't comment in detail on all of the other speakers I tried, but notable contenders were the Tribit XSound Mega which had surprising bass for its size, and the W-King X-10 which sounds pretty good loud but not so much at lower volumes. It's also rather large for a suitcase. The rest sounded like crap out of the box, to me, with little to no low end. Some had an app where I may have been able to make them sound better, but I did not try.I'm very happy with this speaker so far!","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2023",AHHFOMVDJROC4MMFD23LOD5KDMOA,True,44,Color: Black

RICMATGLW44ZR,B07P39MLKH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beats the Doss Soundbox XL Hands Down, Freaking Awesome Sound",Handy,4,"Update: 8-24-19I have now had this thing for a bit over a week and I can truly say that this is the bestportable speaker I have ever had. Battery life is awesome and music is great. Thanks Anker.Sooo, a couple of weeks ago I purchased the Doss Soundbox XL. I had been checking out reviews andI really thought that it would be the speaker for me. I was really excited to get it in my hands.But like finding out your Facebook date looks nothing like the pictures, it was a huge let down.I knew after the first 3 songs that it was nothing like I thought it would be. Very muddy sound,and super small sound window. It was like having a blanket thrown over it.After trying everything I could to fix it, I finally sent it back.As soon as I got the refund I ordered this, the Anker Soundcore Motion+, and waited impatientlyfor it to arrive and have now had it for a bit over 8 hours.I remember when I opened the Doss I was really surprised at how big it was, almost awkward.This was not the case with this speaker. Very nice package and a good weight to it.This thing is simplicity in it's self. Buttons are easy to find, just a momentary push on the powerbutton turns it on and into pairing mode. It starts in ""base up"" mode which was fine for me.Played my first song. Big smile, oh yea. Clear highs, very tight base that was clear and robust.Very nice sound stage. So I did the same thing as I did with the Doss, I took it all over the houseto hear how it sounds. Corners make this thing come alive. It truly is where this speaker wants to live.One thing I learned was that this speaker comes with the ability to play aptx and that Android8.0 or above has this option. This is a Bluetooth tech that allows the music to sound as much likeCD quality as possible using Bluetooth. Bluetooth data has to be compressed to send to the speakerand usually that causes sound quality issues. But this tech aims to fix this and seems to really work well.I then took this speaker with me to a building I'm working on and it's empty right now. It's a big100' x 100' building. It has a few small 8"" corners along the front of the building and I made that it'shome. Kicked up some tunes and got to work. All I can say is this thing simply blows me away in it'sability to project good sound even in such a large empty area. Of course, once I started using equipmentit cannot compete but dang. I would walk out and back into the building and it just sounded awesome.So, now for the only thing I don't like, and the only reason I gave it four stars.The app. Now the app it's self is not really the issue at all. It's the privacy agreementand all the things they make you allow to use it. It's off the charts. If you care anythingat all about your privacy then this app is a no go. And this is where things get ugly.See, you cannot update the firmware without the app. So in order to update the speakersfirmware, I have to accept some very ugly privacy conditions that I simply cannot agree to.Sadly, most people don't even read these anymore. They just click and play. No thought aboutall the stuff that is being sent to Anker in the background. And not just Anker, but all their affiliates.This is like a huge spiderweb of companies that we know nothing about.To get past this, I just installed it and then after getting the update, I just uninstalled it.It's weird, some of their speakers can be upgraded on your pc, but this one cannot.So Anker, please if you read any of these reviews, fix this so we can at least update the speakeron our computers at home without having to accept and agree to terms we don't like. Honestly,I should not have to allow you to have all that information just to use a equalizer and updater.So besides that one issue, this thing rocks like no tomorrow on virtually anything I played on it.And will be my go to portable speaker for as long as the thing will play.Thanks again to Oluv's Gadgets for reviewing this great speaker, I should have trusted your judgementin the first place.Enjoy : )","Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2019",AH5V4FGFB6RGWQGFJZAK5MGAHZUQ,True,31,Color: Black
R2Z4G7YU22UY5E,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Not good for stereo but decent for the price in a small speaker.,JD and MD,4,"Full disclosure: I am a musician and recording professional, so I may be a bit more critical or discerning than the average consumer. That said, I hope this review will help anyone else on a similar quest. I was on the search for a pair of bluetooth speakers to connect in stereo for use in our yard or home. I purchased 2 JBL Xtreme (first edition) at $150 a piece, so $300 for the pair. I had issues with connectivity and could only use them if they were within 5 feet of each other. The sound was decent and plenty loud, but too hyped up in the bass. They made a lot of songs sound muffled or too boomy. The JBL app has no options for EQ so you‚Äôre basically stuck with what you get if you want to use multiple devices to connect.I then looked around and found some great reviews on these Motion+ speakers and liked the price point, plus the fact that I could use a custom EQ. They also use bluetooth 5.0 so I thought it would be better for connectivity. So I ordered 2. Turns out stereo connectivity was only better by about a foot or two! Same issue as the JBLs! Dang. I guess that‚Äôs just what you get when pairing multiple speakers. I live in Portland, OR, so we are not rural, but our yard is a half acre and I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have this much of a problem with interference. Funny how speaker manufacturers all advertise up to 30 feet, but have a disclaimer about it depending on other mysterious factors. Like living in city?The custom EQ was nice for the motion plus speakers, but with some caveats. First off, you are starting with a sound that is so boxy and mid focused, I just wonder what the heck they were thinking. With the default EQ setting, these were absolutely horrible sounding. By cutting some mids, I was able to get a decent sound (posted a picture of my settings) but still a bit boxy. The problem is, in stereo mode, only the master speaker changes with the EQ. This led to a lot of fiddling with connecting and disconnecting the individual speakers to try to get each one EQ‚Äôd the same as the other. After tons of back and forth I was able to get them sounding decent. I found cutting mids reduced the volume output, but sounded better than boosting low and high frequencies.The real problems came about when the Bluetooth connection started get really strange. Volume fluctuations and skipping like a cd that‚Äôs scratched. I had to leave my phone right next to the speaker to resolve the issue, but at about 10 or 15 feet away with no obstructions, there was definitely issues. I returned these after that, as the whole point was to have music filling up our large back yard with a decent sound, but have the phone on my person to be able to DJ tracks.I went to best buy today to try out some other options. I figured one bigger speaker would be a better solution at this point. The Ultimate Ears Hyperboom won...by a mile. That speaker is amazing sounding. Not sure why Amazon doesn‚Äôt sell these new, but for $399 that speaker kills the competition. My search is over. I just ordered one direct from UE.I feel bad for buying and returning speakers but hopefully this review will help someone else who is looking for the best sound for indoor and outdoor use. The bose pro system also sounded great but at $600 it wasn‚Äôt much better than the UE hyperboom....and with no 360 sound, I‚Äôd need two and I am definitely not willing to part with $1200 at this point and I want a more portable option as well.Good luck all you music lovers, and I highly recommend that JBL and Anker/Soundcore look into making something that will compete with UE‚Äôs Hyperboom. That speaker kills the JBL Boombox...and the JBL partybox lineup just sounds loud. No balanced sound, just loud. Sony‚Äôs lineup also sounded decent but a little lacking comparatively. If you‚Äôre like me, and like to hear/feel the sub frequencies, the Hyperboom is a clear winner. JBL boombox is next in line, but my wife hated the look of it.Long review here, but I saw there is a shortage of detailed and technical reviews for what I was looking to get, which is a big sound in an indoor/outdoor portable bluetooth speaker, for a reasonable price.","Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2020",AEZZMXVRUJAWYFY72SGSWECFPY6A,True,6,Color: Black

Smith,5,"I was looking for something beefier than my Oontz 3 Ultra...not that I was ever really unhappy with that critter. It's just that, when you wanna win in the ring, sometime's you gotta go with a mid weight fighter, not the light weight.I will admit that I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to ""bass"". If I can't hear it or feel it, I'm left feeling empty. Especially at a lower volume setting. And, that's where the Oontz 3 disappointed me. Not so much with my new Anker Soundcore Motion Plus.I know, I know... it's not even really fair to compare the two because they shouldn't be in the same ring, throwing punches at each other. All I'm saying, is that if you want a bigger punch, with all of the flair included, I suggest the Anker option.Bear in mind however, that if you decide on the Motion +, you will surrender a round or two on the scoring card of ""portability"". Anker's Motion + is heavier and much larger. It still fits into my bookbag and laptop carrier okay, but there is a noticeable difference when trying to make room for it, and especially when lugging the bags around.With all this being said? I love this new ANKER speaker. And, I don't see myself ever going back to an Oontz Ultra. But, please remember that I am extremely picky when it comes to hearing AND feeling my music.

R1EB8M1E8RTIXU,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Probably the Best Speaker for this Price Range,imyourpal,5,"I put this up for comparison vs my first generation JBL Xtreme and also the first generation Bose Soundlink Mini. Keep in mind that the Soundlink Mini is a smaller speaker and isn't necessarily in the same league, but price wise it is.Volume - JBL Xtreme takes it, Soundcore Motion+ comes in close second, Bose Soundlink Mini hard thirdSound quality - Both the JBL Xtreme and Bose Soundlink Mini had a clear emphasis on bass, to the point where unless you used a third-party equalizer it could get pretty muddy at times. Neither distorted at high volumes, but the DSP definitely showed it's limits. For a party, you might not really care, but for focused listening you'll notice it for sure. I believe that the Xtreme, while rated at 40W output, only gives 20W when played unplugged, but I could be wrong. Soundlink Mini has no wattage output as Bose generally doesn't provide that. Soundcore Motion+ has both speakers beat here - it's got a relatively flat DSP, and the app does have an equalizer that you can customize. Whether plugged in or not, it supposedly outputs it's full 30W. There's clear stereo separation on this speaker as well, and I think (but am not sure) that the JBL Xtreme has two tweeters as well. For this I'd go Soundcore Motion+ first, JBL Xtreme second, and Bose Soundlink Mini third.Size/Portability - JBL Xtreme is the largest but comes with straps, Soundcore Motion+ is second with no case/straps, and SoundLink Mini is smallest with optional cases. The Motion+ is actually pretty easy to transport in my gym bag and I definitely don't notice it there as much as the Xtreme. I'd go with the Motion+ for best overall portability.Inputs - All three speakers have bluetooth/AUX inputs, and the Xtreme takes it one step further with USB inputs. by sheer number of options, JBL Xtreme is first, followed by the Soundcore Motion+ as it has BT 5.0/USB C, and Soundlink Mini last.Weather-Proofing - JBL Xtreme and Soundcore are more or less tied here (waterproof/resistant, dust proof/resistant, have sealed flaps for the ports) while the Soundlink is meant for dry/temperate use only.Battery Life - Considering I've owned the Xtreme and the Soundlink Mini since they came out, their batteries have definitely deteriorated so they don't get the same amount of hours they used to get. I'd say that the Xtreme at it's peak gave me about 8 hours and the Soundlink about 6-8 as well. Motion+ is rated for 12 hours and I've been getting about 10-12 hours. Motion+ first, Xtreme second, Soundlink third.Charging - Both the Xtreme and Soundlink have their own proprietary chargers which can be incredibly inconvenient. Motion+ charges via USB-C and can be charged with some higher powered portable battery packs as well as wall warts, which make it the clear winner. The Xtreme does have the added benefit of providing power through it's USB ports which is handy in a pinch. You could attach something like the Moto Stream and run it off the Xtreme's battery while playing via AUX to have a better party speaker which is kinda neat. Motion+ first, Xtreme and Soundlink tied, with the Xtreme having a slight edge on being able to power other devices as well.App Support - Bonus or negative depending on your view. Bose doesn't have an app for it's first generation speaker so it's not considered. JBL's app is relatively simple, but doesn't provide any EQ for it's Xtreme. You can link another speaker to it, so long as it's supported by it's proprietary Connect... connection (note it does NOT work with Connect+ speakers, so you can't connect the Xtreme to the Xtreme2 which is a bummer). Soundcore app is simple as well, but includes a customizable EQ and allows for your speakers to connect to other Soundcore speakers. Overall I'd give it to the Soundcore Motion+ for it's customizable EQ.To me the contest is clearly between the Xtreme and the Motion+; the Soundlink just doesn't compare despite being priced similarly. I'd say the best overall speaker around this price range is definitely the Motion+ - it covers all of it's bases nicely and can match the Xtreme in enough categories while sounding better. If you can get this speaker for sub $90, then you got yourself a deal!","Reviewed in the United States September 30, 2019",AGIWDIAYZVC6JN52X4JMH3VXRUFA,True,5,Color: Black

It has a led on the power button that is white when it's on or red when it is low on battery power. When you turn it on. It plays the usual anker jingle when powered on and off if you own any of their earbuds and headphones.What I like: it gets loud and it's clear. The bass is not feel it in your chest but it's pretty good better than the tribit for sure. I like the buttons on top, they are big and easy to press. The overall materials and heft to it just gives the impression of durability and good build quality. I also like how thick and big the rubber protector is on the usb c and output connectors section. Of course it's a usb c charging format.The middle of the road things:My tribit speaker lasted about 24 hours before needing to charge but would take 8 hours or more to charge. This one lasts for about 12 hours (haven't really tested it but seems about right plus or minus). However it takes usually 2 to 4 hours to charge back up so take note of that. It's not plug and play (I'll get into that in cons). Power button is smaller than the tribit and located on the side and not as easy to press.What I don't like:The bass button and feature is doodoo. It basically is there to make the default settings better which it does. However the default sound settings are horrible. This is not, I repeat not open up the box charge and play. You really need the soundcore app for this bad boy. It's vital that you go into the app and use the equalizer to make it sound good. Don't use the preset modes they are pretty bad too. there is an issue with that too. If you own any earbuds or headphones there are options to have multiple eq profiles(that you created) that you can switch between. This has 1 so you cannot switch between profiles depending on what your listening to which is perplexing to say the least. The other thing I don't like is the price.my tribit cost me 20 to 30 bucks. This shouldn't cost 100 bucks or 90 bucks at all. This should cost 60 to 75 bucks max regular price. It's louder yes but it really doesn't improve battery life, it's not plug and play and I don't care much about setting it up but just 1 eq profile? Really?In conclusion is it good? Yes. Does it have stupid cons? Yes is it worth full price hell no? Should you buy it? Hell yea but only if on sale not full price.","Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2023",AFSWTPDGR57E567Y5GSOJKRQUN3Q,True,9,Color: Black

Overall loudness is probably not great for parties, but it's just right for our needs.

I have it sitting on a piece of wood on an old drill press in the corner about 8' in the air (16' ceilings), I have a usb-c cord plugged into a wall adapter and into the speaker, and I just leave it on all the time. When i'm going to work in my garage, I just open up blue tooth on my phone, connect to the speaker, and open up pandora and i'm good to go.

R35AC0QGDC97WW,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good but consider the EarFun UBOOM L too,TazMan,4,"The Motion+ is a very good speaker at this price range. To get the best out of it look around on the internet for some EQ recommendations to start with. Keep in mind that every firmware update can affect the sound quality.I honestly wasn't that impressed with this speaker out of the box. I got it dialed in much better by using the EQ in the Soundcore app but there are still some frequencies that are overboosted that I can't tune out with the EQ and since I am using an IOS device Apple doesn't give me anything that will work with Amazon Music.Out out of the box I'd give it a 5/10 for its size. Dialed in I'd say closer to 8/10. I bought the EarFun Bluetooth Speaker UBOOM L at the same time. Basically, no EQ options for it as it doesn't have an app. You can choose sound modes which are for indoor or outdoor which seems to accentuate or attenuate the bass a bit. Out of the box this speaker sounded far better than the Motion+. Even with the Motion+ dialed in the best I could with the EQ the Uboom sounds better. I'd give it an 8.5 or 9/10. The best I've tried in this size group has to be the JBL Charge 5 WiFi.It costs twice as much as the Motion+ or Uboom but I caught it on sale and it was very close in price to the Motion+. It also has the best battery life of the 3.The Motion+ is a good option. The bass lacks compared to the other 2 I've mentioned but mids and highs are pretty good but there is a sort of a peak around 5k that makes it a bit shrill. The other 2 seem to extend better into the bass area.I'd give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars. It is clearly one of the best in this size group. I'd put it a #3 cost no object. I'd put it at #2 if cost is an object. The Uboom is #2 for best sound independent of price and #1 if cost is a significant driver. Best sound is JBL Charge 5 WiFi by a nose so #1 here. I'd put it #3 if cost is very important. If you can catch it on sale, It would be a tough decision between it and the Uboom.","Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2023",AGIWD5JTRA54MGAL4GGQ34HWTIMA,True,2,Color: Black

R2GH4AQZKUBPPH,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars For it's size, can't be beaten. One of my favorites.",David Bryan,5,"I am a totally addicted to Bluetooth speakers and to quality sound. For the most part, you get what you pay for when you buy speakers. In the attached picture, you will see a lot of speakers. There are pros and cons to each one and each one serves a purpose. Here is some of what I've found on each one:Aiwa Exos 9 - This is a great speaker for a party or for camping. It is 200 watts and has an equalizer so that you can get the sound just like you want it. It is very loud, but will distort when you turn it all the way up. It is too large and usually unpractical for most situations.Harmon Kardon Go Play 2 - I like this speaker for indoor use. It is 100 watts and has some deep low end sound. It is heavy and pretty large. The main thing I don't like is that the battery won't last more than about 2 hours when you listen to it at a decent volume.Logitech Boombox - I have two of these and they were my go to speaker for about 5-6 years. The sound is very close to the Anker Soundcore Motion+, but these are quite a bit bigger. Also, I think the Anker Soundcore+ sounds a little better due to the equalizer on the Soundcore.JBL Xtreme (version 1) - This is currently one of my favorite speakers. I use it for listening to music on the beach or around the pool. It has more pronounced bass than the Xtreme 2. It sounds great and has no distortion at full volume and it gets loud. The Anker actually gets very close to as loud, but the Xtreme maintains its bass at it's highest volume and the Anker loses some of it's thump at full volume.Anker Soundcore Motion+ - This is also one on my favorite speakers. I love both the equalize and the volume. It does not distort at full volume, but does lose some bass. It sounds much larger than it's size which means you get a very portable loud speaker with great sound. I am so impressed with how much power this smaller speaker delivers. It is very versatile and will work for almost any occasion.Bose Soundlink Mini II - This speaker is amazing for its size. It is great at lower volumes for listening at home or around a pool. It's portability is hard to beat and it puts out amazing bass for its size. It just doesn't shine when you turn it up as it loses almost all of it's bass when you go past 60-70 percent volume.JBL Flip (version 1) - At one time, this speaker was considered amazing. It is loud for it's size. These days, I'm sure the newer versions are much better when it comes to sound quality. I use this speaker for white noise when I am staying at a hotel or on vacation.Overall, my new favorite speakers are the JBL Xtreme and the Anker Soundcore Motion+. They are both amazing and the JBL is slightly more powerful. The Anker's size, weight, equalizer and power make it more portable/convenient for most listening situations. In all of my years of buying speakers (and I own a lot more than just the ones in this pic), I haven't found a better value for the money. Even if you don't get it at the discounted price, it is huge bargain. If you're on the fence, go for it.

RT179HSU7O04H,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Competition to more expensive brands,Basilisk,5,"I was actually looking to buying similarly sized JBL speaker in my local shop.Luckily, done my research before doing that.JBL - no aux, very basic BT format SBC, rudimentary app, well extended and slightly uneven FR, sounds ok in person besides weird grain somewhere in highs, around 10Hz better bass extension. Price is 3X.Motion Plus - AptX HD and low latency mode, aux in, which I use a lot, can be connected to both my and my gf phones at the same time, 9 band EQ, a bit smaller than JBL, fits my hand well, wide sound dispersion, ok and easy to EQ stock sound and all that while being 70-80 bucks. No brainer.Sound.Sine sweeps by ear subjectively correlate with dips and peaks in RTings measurement from 400Hz and up.Some of FR unevenness can be addressed by EQ in Anker's app, though 4-6 band parametric EQ will solve all the major issues.EQ preset on my screenshot is made on the base of BassUP preset to make the stock FR closer to flat.Removes shouty peak at around 3KHz, zingy peak at approx. 5KHz, fills in some lower treble and air.Values in Db differ from what may appear reasonable by RTings graph - they're adjusted accordingly to my subjective perception during sine sweep runs (for instance, I pushed 2.5KHz down lower, then it ""supposed"" to be accordingly to graph).You can easily adjust value in Db to flatten FR accordingly to RTings graph.Stereo mode.It exists, it works and it is very easy to setup, which is awesome. I wasn't testing it thoroughly, but in my case there is a delay in starting the playback, so first couple of seconds of song are omitted.Since stock frequency response is still very decent, app is great and price is low, motion plus makes a great gift.

R33VIU0WU1MBEU,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent, But Revision/Firmware Differences Limit Functionality",DMA,5,"I originally purchased this Soundcore Motion+ more than a year ago, and once I customized the EQ via the Soundcore app, I was super impressed with the sound quality. I never would have expected such (comparatively) impressive bass in conjunction with crisp, non-shrill highs from such a small enclosure. It has been a joy to use.After reading of how terrific these speakers sound when joined in pairs for the full left/right stereo effect, I purchased another from Amazon yesterday. Alas, after going through the pairing directions multiple times, I had no success in pairing the two speakers.In my research to find out the cause of the problem, I followed Anker's posted instructions on how to reset the speakers, delete the pairings from my phone, etc., but no luck. I then happened upon a post in Anker Community forum where the person had two speakers with two *different* firmware revisions, and they submitted a ticket to Anker to find out if the pairing should still work. Anker responded that: *no, in fact it won't*. When I doubled-checked my speakers, my older speaker (FCC ID ending in A3116) had a firmware revision of 45.xx, while the new one (FCC ID ending in A3116J) has a revision of 75.xx, so that is my issue. It is unclear if Anker would be able to update my older speaker's firmware at some point to match the new one, or if hardware enhancements might prevent this. Presently, though, I am unable to make use of stereo pairing of the two speakers, which is the entire reason I purchased the second Motion+.*Edit: I reached out to Anker support with this question, and they promptly responded that, yes, this is the case: the two versions actually contain different chipsets, and they will NOT pair with one another.****Edit: I originally knocked off one star for this issue, but I have now added it back, as I purchased another of the newer version speakers, and it pairs effortlessly with its twin. I will gift the older version to someone, since I don't need three units. They all sound wonderful, though.I would prefer that Anker make some distinction as to the different revisions of this product and perhaps add a disclaimer about the pairing issue between different versions. If not Anker, then perhaps Amazon could take the initiative and edit the item description. Should potentional buyers want to be able to take advantage of the stereo pairing feature, particularly if they already have a Motion+, I would recommend buying them in pairs to maximize the chances of getting the same hardware revision and firmware.Overall though, it's a fantastic little speaker with wonderful sound quality and sufficient battery life for my needs, and I would highly recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2023",AFEKQJBJSQZUOG54HQF6B7DBYZBQ,True,25,Color: Black
R56I69OFW1W11,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Hail ! The New Junior Welterweight Champ!!!,Gerald S. Brady,5,"I know a lot about and own several Bluetooth speakers. I own I think the largest ""party speaker"" that Anker makes the Rave, which is a very excellent product. I also own a W-King, also a very excellent product. I was using my W-King on my nightstand about 2 feet from my head. I had acquired a desire to upgrade the W-King with something perhaps more elegant and smaller and less utility looking. Eureka! I happened upon this heavenly creature of a Bluetooth speaker. The W-King currently costing $75 dollars is still the best bang for $75. If You are not so poor that you can't squeeze another $25 dollars out of your wallet, I very strongly suggest that you pull those rubber bands from around you wallet, let those moths escape and kerplunk down $100 and buy this box instead. I used my W-King as a reference point in my quest to hopefully replace it. The Motion+ is half the size of the W-King and sexy. It has the build quality and appearance of an Apple product ( Dr. Dre. Pill on illegal steroids.) Hold on to your hat ....... although smaller, this thing plays louder and clearer than the W-King, I mean actually. If I had not myself purchased this and blindfold tested this, I would swear that I was hearing a Bose Wave CD player. I had considered buying a second Motion+ but decided not to. Unless you have to realize the added dimension of stereo you'd be make something that sounds really good, sound really good and loud. I don't need that in my life. A second one of these would be a waste of money as you would always be listening to the two at a low volume setting. (Two of these could work out for you if you throw parties. Your guests would be wondering where is he hiding his towers and subwoofer ?) Thank You Anker !!!! This is a revision to my prior review. I previously stated that owning two of these would be a waste of money. At this time I would like to retract that statement as nonsense. I took the plunge and bought a second Motion+. My position on the matter now is that two of these make something that sounds good, sound better (probably something to do with increased power bandwidth using two). I have these installed on either side of my headboard. I sleep literally bathed in hi-fi. I sometimes sit on the other side of the room astounded that that sound is coming from those tiny drivers and passive radiators, (A coup de gras for Anker research & development and engineering.) However I should point out as some other reviewers have there. is a problem sometimes with bluetooth connectivity. I choose to call this phenomenon ""line of sight radio wave interference"". If you learn to live with this system, the problem will loom as minuscule. Also some reviewers have complained about the sound quality. I could only imagine that these people do not or don't know how to use the included Soundcore equalizer. ( With this, and any audio system a graphic equalizer is essential to optimize performance and sound quality.) Using Anker's or any good equalizer app plugin I can find nothing wrong with the sound of this box. ( What doe's anyone require from a box that's 9.5 by 3 inches and cost one hundred dollars and has a battery and is portable, and fits in your pocket if you wear a big coat ???!!!).

R2IIVN3WSFIFI,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Wow! Soundcore Motion+ vs JBL,Tammy W.,5,"I have to say, as far as bluetooth speakers go, I've always been a big JBL fan. I've had a JBL Xtreme, Flip 3, Flip 4, Clip 2 and Clip 3. Recently my Flip 4 battery began to die so I started researching replacements. My natural inclination was to get a Flip 5, which I did order from Amazon and eventually used for a comparison with the Motion+. I watched a bunch of You Tube video comparisons each proclaiming how good the Motion+ is. I also read a ton of comments on Amazon so I decided to order it. This thing is unbelievable for a $100 speaker! I have to say I was a bit skeptical, but it really lives up to all the positive ratings and comments. Based on the sound comparison with a Flip 5 (which may or may not really be fair), it blew the Flip 5 away. Probably a JBL Charge 4 or 5 would be a more fair comparison, but I don't have one so I can only speak to what I could actually compare. What I noticed: 1) Clarity - incredible clarity even at high volumes. At around 75-80%, JBL began to lose some clarity. Motion+ was still clear as a bell. 2) Stereo! JBL doesn't to my knowledge have any true stereo speakers. Motion+ actually plays in stereo (yea!) 3) Amazing bass for its size. It's not going to give you the same level of bass as, say, a Bose S1 Pro (which I also have), but you can't expect that it will. However, for its size, the bass is punchy, deep and clear. Make sure to use the bass boost function. 4) There's an equalizer app available for Android or iPhone. What a nice feature! 5) Other nice features: IPX7 water resistant and rugged shell - just like JBL. If you're looking for new speaker or even your first one - definitely at least give the Motion+ a try.UPDATE: I recently got my hands on a Bose Soundlink Color II and did a sound comparison. The Motion+ blew the Bose out of the water. I'm always tempted to try something new and see if it beats the Motion+, but so far nothing near this price can compare.Another comparison: I tried the Motion+ against the new Bose Soundlink Flex. While the actual sound of the Bose was superior and had some nice punchy bass, the Motion+ was louder and still held its own to the Bose. Morion+ wins it for outdoor use for sheer volume. I do think the Bose Flex wins for sound clarity and smoothness and would probably be better for indoor use.Update 7/23/2024: I just ordered another Soundcore Motion+ to pair two of them together. I'm very disappointed that you cannot pair on older version Motion+ with the new version. Soundcore: please fix this! In the meantime, I'm sending the new one back. My old one is still going strong after 3 years!","Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2021",AH6EWYO4Q4Y5DBPVIUT2NWNQZKOQ,True,9,Color: Black
R1TDNL0MLH7I97,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Great speaker for small spaces,R. J. Reding,4,"My nearly 20 year old Bose Sounddock finally died and I was looking for replacement with good sound and small size. The Anker Soundcore Motion Plus has been a great replacement. I believe the sound is equal to my old Bose. I had purchased a small Soundcore 2 several years ago for use on my patio and travel and was very impressed with the sound. This Soundcore Motion Plus has an even more solid bass and clear treble and is a perfect size for our small living room. The bass boost is solid and with 30W of power should fill most spaces with thundering volume. Two devices can be linked for a true stereo effect, but for a small room the sound experience with a single unit is excellent The device is water and splash resistant for outdoor use, but gives piece of mind for use in my living room where spills from cats and grandkids are possible or if I wanted to take it to the kitchen. It would also be perfect for use at your cabin or on your deck or patio. The exterior does have a rubber like coating, but comes in several colors that look fine for your indoor spaces.There are a couple of small issues. Because it is battery powered you will have to physically turn it on to use it. Battery life is quite long, but It will turn off automatically when not in use with an auto shut off feature that can be adjusted via a phone or tablet app. It would have been ideal to have it turn on via the phone app or through an Alexa voice app. The manual that ships with the device is useless pictograms. Fortunately I was able to find a written owners manual online and one is available with the phone app. The equalizer on the phone app only allows you to turn the bass boost on or off. It would have been nice to have actual equalizer controls over a range of frequencies or preset equalizations for music or room type. However both my Android phone and an Alexa app have equalizer features. Aside from the pictogram quick guide set up was easy and the Bluetooth sync was without problems for both my phone and Alexa. The app also allows for firmware updates, but also includes push notifications. The device also supports the latest Bluetooth codex, though your connected devices may not offer that higher standard e.g. generation 1 and 2 Alexa devices. The speaker can however be directly connected with aux line in with an included cable.Overall the Anker Soundcore Motion Plus was exactly what I was looking for and at the price I wanted to pay. Given my good experience with my Anker Soundcore 2 speaker I would expect this product to be equally trouble free.","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2022",AF6SON7PE54ISGTP7IWKTUBIFLXQ,True,1,Color: Black

While that is perfectly acceptable for listening to podcasts indoors, the sound quality is lacking for music. And it's not loud enough to use outdoors without significant distortion. In the last year I've shifted back towards more music listening, and needed a speaker upgrade. There are a ton of options, and you could spend a lot more money if you wanted the absolute best sound quality. The reviews for the Soundcore Motion+ were generally good to very good, so I took a chance because I've had a great track record with Anker products. The other options I considered were the JBL Flip 6, JBL Charge 5, Ultimate Ears Boom 3, and Bose SoundLink Flex. I'm listing these for reference to the price range, quality, and size I was looking at before purchasing the Soundcore Motion+.Pros:-Overall excellent sound quality. I have never been one to buy the best quality speakers, but this sounds significantly better than the small speakers I've gathered over the years and probably better than my Subaru Crosstrek Sport 2021. It is not as good as my old school Aiwa and Sharp 3-piece stereo boomboxes, but it's pretty close. For reference I mostly listen to metal and rap, and I judge sound quality on how my favorite metal bands sound on different speakers.-The form factor is rock solid and sits flat. It's going to be more stable than other options that are more cylindrical and especially the speakers that sit upright.-Directional speakers over the wraparound style. I want a speaker that directs sound towards me and doesn't fill the room, especially at work.-Battery life is excellent. It is listed as 12 hours but I think it's quite a bit more. Technology websites have tested it being closer to 16 hours.-USB-C charging and Aux ports. These days it's hard to find Aux ports on speakers. If you have an old iPod like me then it's nice to have that Aux option.Cons:-Heavy and bulky compared to other options in this price range. I have no problem grabbing the Soundcore 2 to move it around the house or between labs and offices at work, but the weight of this makes me think twice about casually grabbing it.-Charging is slow, longer than I'm used to with the Soundcore 2 and other small electronic devices.-Minor quibble, I wish all of the buttons are a little bigger.","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2023",AEWIZKAI3H4NTZISXLY4U3HUFH4A,True,11,Color: Red

I have nothing negative to say about this Soundcore Motion Plus! Get it, get the app, and if you have $200 to buy 2 of them‚Ä¶DO IT. You‚Äôll be quite blown away with the SQ for $200.

R1A2FSU8UK9HYN,B07P39MLKH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Solid for a long while, now battery is toast",RJ,4,"I purchased this in April 2022. It's now October 2023. This used to be my daily driver for all-things-home-audio at home until I purchased the SoundCore Motion x600 in May 2023. I love that. Once I got stuck on that, this kind of got stuck on a shelf. Back then, the battery life was acceptable, but I don't think it was ever near 12hours like advertised. Maybe half that, maybe a bit less. Not a biggie. However, in my attempts to have one bluetooth device for each PC / phone that played audio to avoid the struggles of trying to determine which device was taking over which bluetooth device, I started using this again.Battery life now is about non-existent. I don't have exact figures, but I expect it's easily within an hour it dies if not plugged in when in use. I basically have to leave it plugged in, which works for its use case, but not ideal. I have a lot of Anker products in my shopping history here going back almost 10 years. A large number of those products are in use today still. Possibly I got a dud here. It's a solid bluetooth speaker, and while I'd usually go with Anker over other brands in a number of categories, certainly against others in the same price range, I'm not sure I'd get this particular speaker again, as good as it sounds.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2023",AFRFJ3MRUMG3NAYTSCTHSIBBI75Q,True,1,Color: Black
R1OF459KAAYVO8,B07P39MLKH,3.0 out of 5 stars Awesome speaker; appallingly short Bluetooth range.,No,3,"I‚Äôve had this speaker for a little over a year now. In almost all respects, I have been very impressed. Unfortunately, the Bluetooth range (or lack thereof) is a serious flaw.The good:The sound quality is amazing for such a small speaker. I never would have expected such a rich bass from a speaker this size.The Soundcore app allows me to customize the EQ for my tastes. This allows me get the most out of the small speaker without washing out the overall sound with pure volume.Charging, portability, and durability are all right where they should be. Again, very impressed by the quality.The bad:The Bluetooth range is appallingly limited. I have connected the speaker to multiple iPhones. Most of my Bluetooth devices can maintain a solid connection well over 20 yards, especially if the devices are within line-of-sight. This speaker, however, will start to drop a Bluetooth connection in less than 5 yards, even without obstacles in the way.It is a serious flaw. There is no point in having a Bluetooth connection if the phone needs to be that close to the speaker. I might as well buy a 3.5mm cable and just hardwire the connection.If you want to use the speaker during a backyard cookout, that‚Äôs fine. But you‚Äôll have to leave your phone sitting right next to the speaker instead of in your pocket as you walk around.Again, it‚Äôs a great speaker, but the short Bluetooth range is a serious flaw.____UPDATE after another 6 months:*When connected to the charger, it may not be able to draw enough power to function at higher volumes. I used it at a party recently, and I had to keep the volume at maximum (or close to it). The battery died after about 3 hours; no surprise there. I hooked up the charging cable and turned it back on. Every 10 to 15 minutes it would die again. I'm assuming that, at full volume, it uses more power than it can draw through the charging cable. This is very disappointing. This is the only time I have used it on max volume for extended times and the only time I have used it hardwired to the charger. But it should be able to draw power consistently enough to function.For what it's worth, even at the high volumes the sound quality was still impressive. The bass was a little lacking, but it's still impressive.*The bluetooth range is still appalling. It's also inconsistent. I actually got it to connect at around 20 yards the other day. But it would randomly crackle out or drop the connection. Again, I eventually just placed my phone right next to the speaker.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023",AFYI4JVG2NYFLOBVED2TLERIPIAA,True,5,Color: Black
R321LM3M3OT3WY,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars I returned my equivalent Bose speakers for these and never looked back,Kalel-510,5,"Sound quality and volume are excellent in these portable, wireless, Bluetooth-connected Anker speakers. Very little distortion at higher levels. I had a few connectivity issues until I got the hang of it, but everything is jake now.I had a pair of the equivalent ($99) Bose wireless portable speakers and returned them for these.Anker vs. Bose comparison:* Sound is superior in Anker speaker. Bose does offer the choice of mono or stereo sound.* App needed to pair Bose speakers. No app needed to pair Anker speakers.* Once Anker speakers are paired, they stay paired when you turn the speakers on again. No need to re-pair as with Bose.* Anker has an equalizer function to customize music. Stays at the setting when turned on again.* When the Anker speakers are paired, when you turn one off the other shuts off as well. Bose speakers must be shut off individually.* When music is paused, the Anker speakers stayed powered up for much longer than the Bose speakers, roughly 20 vs. 5 minutes. With the Bose I always felt that if I left the room for a couple of minutes, I had to open the app again and re-pair the speakers.One item to note--when I first got the Anker speakers some songs started half a second into the song intro, a semi-annoying problem I once had with a pair of earbuds. However, that issue seems to have resolved itself.The sound between the Anker speakers will ""drift"" from time to time. That is, sound will fade in one of the speakers and increase in the other for a second or two before equalizing again. Happens occasionally and is not annoying enough to put me off the speakers.I would have preferred a vertical rather than a horizontal orientation, but the Anker speakers are very solid and portable. I love to move them around the room so that no matter where I am, I am perfectly between the two speakers.There's something about the speakers that make the music very comfortable, almost soothing, to the ears. I I never want to turn them off.I had a pair of the equivalent Bose speakers and returned them for these. A friend of mine did the exact opposite, but that's because she wanted the mono sound option in the Bose. Some people think it's better for parties because no matter where you are in relation to the speaker, you can hear all the instruments in the song.I am very happy to give these Anker speakers two enthusiastic thumbs up.","Reviewed in the United States September 17, 2021",AGDE2OJXVZ4B2UV6ZYUH5JKLVCJQ,True,2,Color: Black
R29GO5GDCXQAHN,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Phenomenal Sound for the price,Ajani Grant,5,"After some faithful years my JBL Charge 3 has fizzeled out. Resorting to being on the charger to work. Reddit actually led me to find this speaker.Pros:Budget. As it was on Sale for $85 versus a charge 5 at roughly ~160, and everything else far above thatSound( with tweaking). The audio out this thing is amazing. Not life changing. Not ridiculous. But as someone who primarily listens to hip-hop, jazz, and r&b, this speaker in it's 6-8 hours of usage already has blown me away. It gets loud. It has crisp bass, decent mids, and pretty clear highs. For the price range this is what I've come to expect and it has matched expectationsPairing. By holding Bluetooth you can pair two of these speakers together and this naturally offers double the amazing sound and you can truly fill a bedroom with music. I'd compare the experience to having a massive soundbar (like an entire walls length) with a mini subwoofer. It's actually an incredibly immersive experience. And once again, the price of this thing means buying two might not hurt your bank terriblyVolume. Even with a singular speaker I can easily fill my bedroom with more than enough sound. In a masterbedroom, half the room is drowned with music and the other is conversation level.Cons:Battery. The battery at 75-100% volume will die at roughly 4-6 hours. I've had two sessions on one battery session right out the box before resorting to charge. That's not terrible to be honest but worth mentioning as a conMax Volume Sound. You are going to sacrifice some quality of sound as you increase volume pass 75-80%. I don't notice distortions, but the bass actually gets outpowered by mids and highs which slap out, for lack of better terms. I do find this problem remedied with pairing two speakers and having them on opposite ends of the roomOverall:I look forward to seeing how long this speaker lasts me. First impressions are strong. I am happy for now. The battery is a minor con for the overall quality of the products sound. Make sure to download the Soundcore application and check reviews for your personal custom tweaking. This is completely unpaid just decided to write because Anker has never disappointed in my household.Easy 8-9/10 product. If it lasts the years this should easily be your go to 10/10 portable Bluetooth speaker.

In fact, I never felt the need to have this above 40% volume and this just sounds great.It was annoying at first since it randomly increased the volume during audio playback & when changing or restarting tracks but after unpairing from my devices and resetting the speaker, it seems to have solved the issue.I would have preferred physical buttons for previous and next track instead of the useless ""Bass up"" button since the feature can be enabled in the app. You'd need the app for firmware updates and sound customization and other settings, like auto off when not in use which you can set to your preferred time.The power button is a bit stiff and it's an arm workout to turn on this speaker. It also just dies abruptly without any sound notification when using the aux cable (not sure if its thw same with Bluetooth) and takes over 4 hours to fully recharge.You'd want to enable ""Bass up"" or Custom but with a flat profile because it sounds exactly like Bass up.

R1XARHZH2G2SE6,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars AMAZING for electronic music,Kyle Archer,5,"A disclaimer: I use this speaker with Android and use only FLAC audio files which means I'm taking full advantage of the AptX Bluetooth codec. If your phone doesn't support AptX (like an iPhone) I wouldn't recommend the Motion +. Find something that supports AAC instead.Ok, so I'll be honest. I don't care for this speaker for rock music. That's my big criticism. The rock I listen to is heavily layered and drenched in distortion and reverb. Think ""wall of guitars"" style. In other words the sound is huge and occupies the whole spectrum as a sort of singular mass of sound. My Galaxy Buds + handle this perfectly but The Motion + seems to have a hard time and the sound is unbalanced, like the speaker is trying to emphasize a certain frequency that doesn't make sense for this music. Random frequencies of guitar distortion are elevated and it sounds really off, even after playing with the EQ setting.However for anything electronic I've found this speaker sounds absolutely stunning and it seems to me that's what the Motion + is geared for. The clarity is unreal, especially for a Bluetooth connection. I listen to everything from heavy bass EDM to rich, ethereal ambient music. With the bass heavy EQ there is a massive bass presence but it remains a refined, tight sound instead of a muddy boom like many other Bluetooth speakers. The mids retain clarity and punch despite the bass and the treble is clear as glass. All in all the sound is incredibly high quality and perfectly balanced but again, just for electronic music in my experience. This doesn't bother me too much because this is primarily what I listen to but many people aren't into electronic so I thought I'd state this for fans of rock and metal. Another thing to mention is the overall presence of the music. I can flip this speaker around to face the wall and it still somehow fills the room with crystal clear sound. The battery life is very long, charging happens pretty quick, and the aethetic of this speaker is just as appealing as everything else.To recap: If you're an Android user and you love electronic music just buy this thing. You'll be blown away. For everyone else though I'd say there are much better options out there.","Reviewed in the United States May 14, 2022",AF33Y2RIQHKDYOUV2QAUIFIZZYTA,True,3,Color: Black
R31ZMRWYQKIQ64,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Loud and Clear,Mark,5,"My old 12 watt Anker Soundcore was too quiet for some audio books. I drive endless hours over the highways delivering your food to distribution centers. Headsets are seen by the DOT at the pre-clearance sites with those big cameras looking right inside the cab of the truck. Also even the bone induction headsets cause an achy soreness after a few hours so a Bluetooth speaker is essential for listening when the truck radio's Bluetooth auxiliary is bad. This new 30 watt Soundcore+ is plenty loud even when climbing up a 6% grade with 40,000 pounds cargo and the huge engine is screaming and the giant fan is blasting like a turboprop at takeoff. I mistakenly bought an Oontz unit with 24 watts and it does not connect easily nor provide adequate clarity or volume, the Anker Soundcore connects effortlessly. Easy automatic reconnect even after my audio book is interrupted by a phone call. I've left the speaker on all night while I sleep and there's plenty of juice left for NPR news with coffee at 4 AM without plugging in the USB. I really truly benefited from the ""table"" of products I found on Amazon for the Anker Soundcore speakers. With that I found the perfect unit for my truck. My old 12 watt unit lasted about 4 years blasting it's little heart out for me before it ruptured a diaphragm. I was so sad it blew up so when I found the table of Anker Soundcore speakers I grabbed-up my 30 watt unit because I trust the brand. I couldn't be happier with it. You might think that speech in an audio book would not need quality sound, but the high-res digital audio reproduces excellent clarity at any volume I need. Quality sound is important for audio books so you catch every nuance and inflection of the voice actor. I bought it specially for the truck and I just love it's audio quality, substantial physical weight and higher volume capacity, battery life is over the top, and I know it will withstand the high vibration and moisture environment and keep blasting away because it's little brother did.

R3HKYV5DWFVH6P,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible value!,da_musicman,5,"I own an original Bose Soundlink, a Bose Soundlink Mini 2 Special Edition and the Soundcore Motion+. The Motion+ is far and away the best value of the three. It‚Äôs midrange beat the pants off both Bose speakers. Without side by side comparison, I think most people would be happy with a any of these speakers but when compared side to side, my preference is definitely for the Motion+. It's the only one with a remote that has a graphic equalizer. That‚Äôs huge! The ability to fine tune the sound to your individual hearing gives it a gigantic edge. It sounds clean and full with decent bass (not overly exaggerated) and excellent midrange and highs. It has good build quality and is also waterproof. It can also be paired to a second Motion+ for a wider stereo soundstage. (The new Bose models also have this capability. There is a microphone for using it as a Bluetooth speaker phone if that floats your boat. It has a battery life rated at 12 hours though I haven‚Äôt had it long enough to deplete the initial charge. The Soundlink Mini 2 has a similar battery rating and I have to say is an engineering marvel. Though not perfect, the sounds that comes out of that tiny thing is nothing less than amazing. I think the original Bose Soundlink has the best soundstage of the three, followed by the Mini. The soundstage on the Motion+ is decent but not quite as good as its competitors. However, I think the overall sound quality of the Motion+ across the frequency spectrum is definitely the best. Highs (electric guitar) on the Mini can be somewhat strident and sounds much more smooth and natural on the Soundcore Motion+. The Soundcore just seems to have a much fuller sound with nothing or very little missing. (Keep in mind that these are all small portable Bluetooth speakers not high end studio monitors driven by great amplifiers so they all have limitations!) When switching to the Soundlink Mini 2, it sounds like something is missing. Oh, did I mention that the price of the Soundcore is only 100 bucks?! The Soundlink Mini 2 Special Edition is $150 at Costco. That‚Äôs 50% more and doesn‚Äôt sound as good to me. The original Soundlink sold for $300 if my memory serves me correctly. If size is a driving factor, then the Bose Mini 2 is worth exploring. However, if you can put up with a little larger but still relatively small speaker, in my opinion you will not find a better sounding speaker than the Soundcore Motion+ in the $100-$200 price range. It‚Äôs a solid buy. Anker did a great job with this speaker.","Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2021",AG7CABQBZF37LILPWYLUJ2OA5OEQ,True,1,Color: Black
RRGX14M3T4XYQ,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive sound, Bluetooth is weird",Aaron Reitz,5,"I got this to make computer audio audible when playing videos outside with my small group. For the price, the sound is pretty impressive, with decent bass and no obvious peaks. I think the output is mono, even though the speaker contains two drivers -- not a big deal on a small speaker meant to be listened to from a distance. It feels very solid and heavy in the hand and the body has a soft-touch coating on the plastic, giving a nice feel. (Note, though, that I've seen these coatings degrade into a gooey mess on other products, though I haven't had any issues so far on the Motion+.)My main gripe is with the way the speaker handles audio connectivity.First, when using it with a computer, I generally want to use the wired connection for audio rather than Bluetooth. However, the Motion+ defaults to trying to connect via Bluetooth every time you start it up, and sometimes it is difficult to figure out how to make it fall back to the wired connection. There is something flakey about its detection that the audio cable is plugged in.Second, I don't know if this is a problem with the Motion+ or with Bluetooth in general, but I've seen some weird behavior when multiple devices have been configured to connect with the speaker. Sometimes I'd have it connected with a computer one foot away by Bluetooth when suddenly the audio would cut out and I'd start hearing some other audio playing. It turns out that the speaker was switching to playing from my mother-in-law's iPad, that must have been 20-30 feet away at the time. It is maddening to me that another device could just cut in on an existing Bluetooth connection like this. It seems like a major security flaw. Strangely, I've also seen my phone try to play audio to the speaker even when I am miles away at the time, as if the phone can't tell that the speaker isn't present. Due to these issues, sometimes I have to just tell my devices to forget the speaker. It's really frustrating.Still, I don't run into these issues often enough to make the speaker unusable, and maybe I need to apply a firmware update or something. I'd still recommend the product for it's high-quality audio for the price.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2022",AGW5PEVKSAHGE34IPTUWCPWNDZJQ,True,2,Color: Black

Everything is game, and this speaker handles it all impressively. From Coltrane to the Stones, and everything between.Out of the box, the frequency response is flat. That is by design, to give you a reference point for shaping the sound the way you want. To appreciate the capabilities of this speaker you MUST download the Soundcore app, where you can adjust the EQ to whatever suits you. There are several presets in the app, but the real difference-maker is in the ""custom"" setting, which gives you 9 bands of EQ to fiddle with. If I had to describe this speaker's performance in one word, that word would be ""balanced"". If you're into bass-dominant listening (rap/hip-hop), you'll probably be better served by one of the boom-box models.

R2ODBY2ZJQ8B9T,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible sounding speaker,Dave,5,"I bought this speaker primarily to use outdoors on my deck and patio areas. I researched reviews for bluetooth speakers under $100 from several reliable audio and tech websites; then watched YouTube demos. I narrowed my choices to Anker, Tribit, JBL and Oontz. I chose the Anker Soundcore Motion + for it's driver configuration (full range drivers with separate tweeters, passive radiator and bass port), 30-watt power and size. The ability to customize the sound with the Soundcore app was also a deciding factor.When I received the speaker, I was pleased with the build quality. Initial set-up was a snap, took less than a minute. I downloaded the Soundcore app and reviewed it's features and available options.Now, for the audition. Let me preface by saying, I am a guitar player. I listen to real music, played by real musicians, playing real instruments. I do NOT listen to computer-generated, sampled, auto-tuned disposable crap (no offense to those that do; everyone should listen to what they dig). I began with Fleetwood Mac's self-titled album from 1975 in ultra-HD on Amazon music. It's impeccably produced and has a great drum mix (a true test for any speaker) I scrolled through the pre-sets on the Soundcore app for the first track and dialed in my custom EQ on the available equalizer. I turned up the volume and stood back about 12 feet from the speaker. My jaw dropped. I could not believe the sound coming from this portable little speaker. Great full-range audio from lows to highs. Mick's drum were punchy and deep. Much better bass response than I anticipated (though I did need to dial it in with the EQ). Wonderful separation of instruments, crystal-clear vocals. The soundstage was surprisingly wide with good depth for a single speaker configuration (non stereo setup). I was impressed (and I am not easily). I mainly listen to vinyl or CD on vintage, audiophile quality equipment (I also stream in ultra HD with a quality DAC). The Soundcore Motion + far exceeded my expectations.Are there bluetooth speakers out there that are better, or louder or have more bass? Yes, of course. But not for $80.

RGV7Y77KCH4HF,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Physics cannot be cheated; the hype is unfounded,Frank Doghearty,4,"(08/10/2020) After several months of satisfactory performance, I am raising my rating from 3 to 4.(Original review:) In order to be fair, I used the wired connection for this review. (The speakerphone feature works well, which alone is making this a keeper for me.)The tiny drivers simply cannot produce anything close to a pair of 30-year-old Sony amplified speakers with 3"" drivers. In fact, the sound resembles the tiny USB speakers that came out 15-20 years ago, possibly because that's where its sound comes from: tiny speakers. Of course, for the price, you do get some privileges: namely, bass-reflex design and silk domes, both of which far surpassing the potentials of cheap, tiny computer speakers.Some reviewers did note that using the app would give away ""your voice"" for free, so that is obviously not an option for those who care for that sort of thing. Without the utility that enables various equalizer settings (out of which the basic setting should have been built in to begin with), the device falls flat, exhibiting all the shortcomings that its tiny drivers entail (the uncompressed sound coming from an iPad 3, using music and movies from Amazon Prime). Severely colored sound, bad to the point that even mp3 sound just as ""good"" (or shall I say, bad) as uncompressed sound. Some people compared the sound to a DOSS Soundbox SL, but the latter actually reflects the difference between mp3 and uncompressed sound to the point that mp3 comes through severely distorted, because that's just the way mp3 sounds like. Of course, that makes this unit a winner for listening to mp3. For the Soundbox SL, that's a punishment for producing untainted sound (of course, there are better speakers out there, but they also cost more; I got my SL for $56 at the manufacturer's site and got $30 off this one, which I still find a bit much for the actual performance, although I am sure that two of these would be much better than a single unit and these can be paired for stereo sound, as opposed to the current Soundbox SL).NOTICE that my DOS Soundbox stopped working properly after about 10 uses, but is out of warranty, and this one is working fine!The bells and whistles, silk domes for the treble and a passive membrane for the ""bass"" do contribute, although only the treble is fairly improved, because such tiny drivers simply cannot defeat physics. Realistically speaking, ""bass"" starts over 100Hz, and any tweaking simply upsets the sound image and the sound balance.The price is paid for1. Outstanding battery life2. Being somewhat waterproof (I would not venture to experiment with that, but splashproofness seems reasonably true)3. Sophisticated design with extra ""bass"" (that is not really bass)4. Silk domes5. The option to pair two of these for stereo sound6. Excellent BT performance7. There is some stereo imaging, if you are using this below a matchingly small screen.However, if you are looking for a steady sound image without loudness and detailed, dynamic sound, look elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2019",AHXUNV656OFRHCTBGKYFCYS6UEHQ,True,13,Color: Black

R2SC66DMOUNCBC,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Anker customer support reached out, perfectly resolved!",Matthew,5,"Rewrite from an earlier review as Anker has reached out to me. But they did NOT ask me to edit or change my review. This is all my own doing (just a heads up).Initially, I had purchased this product due to all the stellar reviews from various audio reviewers. Item arrives and there is a terrible static, almost like a grounding wire was knocked loose, I'm not sure. Imagine turning on a CRT tv in the middle of the night at full volume with no signal. I had used the motion+ in a different system, different set-up, even had some friends of mine try a hand at it just to make sure it wasnt me.But it happens, there's bound to be a dud every so often. I returned the unit for a replacement. And that replacement, same exact thing. Same steps to troubleshoot but at that point, I was done with the product. I do have more anker products than I can count, they make some great hardware, but the motion+ in particular I figured I was done with. Let other people enjoy it, not worth the headache.I left an earlier review expressing as much and sure enough, a customer rep from Anker actually reached out to me. I like most people have grown very cynical when it comes to dealing with companies standing by their products and actually honoring their warranties BUT the entire experience has more than made up for the earlier issues. I'm still waiting on the replacement to arrive but until then, 5/5 at least for the customer service experience, and that's saying a lot these days.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2023",AHHH34PFU33JE5K5W5SPHHUD5IWA,True,2,Color: Black
R12GV6OMFVNVCQ,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Upgrade!,Stephen,5,"My use case: Needed a better speaker for my desktop computer at work so I could listen to music and do conference calls as I upgraded from laptop to a beefy desktop for some heavier development work I was doing that required multiple virtual machines and all the memory I could afford.For music, I'm not a trained ear, but it packs a lot of bass for a small device even at lower volumes and sounds great for the kind of music I listen to while developing (dubstep, lofi electronic music, classical, jazz, the rat pack, michael buble, r&b, rap). Seems to do well enough across the gamut but I like it best for lower volume bass heavy instrumental music that I listen to while doing other tasks.I've tried to use other bluetooth speakers I have that have aux ports for my PC (bose home speaker 300 in particular). In comparison: - This sounds as good or better to me, bose has a special warmth to it that this lacks but this seems more accurate and punches with just as much bass for a small speaker array. - This is portable/has a battery that the bose doesn't - The bose thinks I'm talking to alexa all the time and does weird things that this doesn't - The bose requires me to turn it back to ""Aux"" mode every time i sit down at my computer, not sure why - The bose doesn't have a mcirophone in it, this does and seems to work wellMinor complaints for my use case: - Super short cords USB-C and aux cords - going to have to fix that - The port cover on the side is a little annoying to have to leave open to get to the power/aux ports - It doesn't do bluetooth and aux sound at the same time while playing from your phone. This is more minor annoyance because some apps play silent sound constantly when they are in the foreground which mutes computer sound even though nothing is playing. More an issue with ios/those apps, but it's annoying when you get on a conference call and can't figure out why you can't hear people. You can have a phone connected that's not playing any sound and play the computer audio without issue though.

I think it was maybe my friend David.Anyway, without opening his mouth, he spoke deep into my soul. A rumbling, almost tectonic voice:""DO YOU FEEL COMPLETE?""I could not speak, only a slight shake of my head once I understood that my answer was no.""DO YOU FEEL THE VOID, THE MISSING PIECE OF THE PUZZLE?""I nodded, more assertively this time, without hesitation.""I CAN SHOW YOU THE WAY TO ENLIGHTENMENT, IF YOU ARE READY.""This time I spoke. A raw, unfettered vocalisation from deep within me. I could see my words taking the form of light, twisting this way and that, on their journey toward the dark figure. ""Yes. I feel ready. Please make me whole, I am ready. I am ready.""A pause which felt like a lifetime ended as the figure (still probably David) began taking in a huge breath. He took in more and more, as if preparing for a war cry. I could barely contain myself. I shook in my place, my gaze transfixed. I had totally surrendered to whatever might happen now. My soul was his.As soon as he started to speak, so began a sort of time-lapse of my whole life up to that point, like a flick book of all the important moments in my life. It brought me to tears. I wept joyous, rapturous tears as his voice, now even more seismic, finally told me what I'd been waiting so long to hear:""SOUNDCORE MOTION+ WITH USB-C CHARGING, 6,700mAh BATTERY, 12-HOUR PLAYTIME, 40kHz SILK DOME TWEETERS WITH ACTIVE CROSSOVER, CUSTOMIZABLE EQ, BLUETOOTH 5.0, AND IPX7 WATERPROOFING""I woke with a jolt, fresh tears in my eyes and adrenaline coursing through my body.

R2P7QEIOOGPNOR,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Buy it.,P,5,"As many other reviews have stated this is an almost perfect, and to some perfect, bluetooth speaker. I waited a few weeks before leaving a review to be sure, but I love it. The sound quality is excellent, as many others have stated this thing gets LOUD. Use the custom EQ for the best sound (I'm a rap fan so as a bass heavy genre it handles it perfectly!) Noticed minor clipping on certain songs (""Top Back"" by T.I. for anyone who knows it as an example) just go down one notch from max and it's good. Definitely plan on buying a second to link together and my ONLY gripe is that it won't accept more lol. It CAN play while charging if not charging from a fully dead battery, it will cut off until it reaches a certain level. Haven't played it constantly so I can't speak to the total battery life just yet, however, I've used it intermittently for a couple hours for an entire week and it lasted with no problems so I imagine a full day at the beach would be fine. The update solved the issues in the comments on the EQ saving and mine saved right out the box. Outside of that, it's done everything I needed and more, can't wait until we can get back out and I can use it for it's intended purpose! Stop reading reviews. I read over 400 on various competing products and watched hours of YouTube videos so I got you on the research lol this is the one.Update: 12/21/21: I've owned this speaker for about 2 years now so I have a full understanding of it's quirks and features and everything in between. My original statement still stands..... BUY IT. I have since bought another and saw someone else mention they are running more than 2 so please share how because I would have one in every room of the house if I could. These have been everywhere. Thrown in the back of the truck on beach day and plays LOUD the entire day. When we hit the beach it's from 10-5 and they last the entire time. I have received so many compliments from other people on the quality of sound from such a small speaker and the speakers themselves have been all in sand, had water on them and continue running without a hiccup. Someone mentioned it being ""invisible to bluetooth"" not sure what they were doing but I can hook these up to anything (and have)... Phones, my laptop, my surface, my TV, everything. I've been checking for an updated version but honestly if it's not broke then don't fix it and these just work perfectly.

Sometimes, I just don't want to have to wear earbuds.The Soundcore Motion+ did not disappoint. It's a solid performer, has punchy bass, and you can tune the EQ to your heart's content via the app. The speaker has heft, thanks to the 12-hour battery life. It feels like a quality product. It also has USB-C charging, which is a must in 2023.If I were to nit about anything, if you hold the speaker up to your ear, you can hear a distinct hiss when nothing's playing.

Calvert,5,"I've had a lot of Bluetooth speakers: Sony, JBL, Creative, Logitech, UE, Bose.....but I have to say I have become a true soundcore fan. Besides this speaker, I also have the Motion Boom and the Motion Boom Plus. They all sound phenomenal. In my opinion, Soundcore gives you the most bang for your buck. The Motion + has become one of my favorite speakers, so much so that I just ordered this one so I could hook them up in stereo. Unfortunately when I got this speaker I couldn't get them to connect even though I followed the instructions. I was informed by Soundcore that this was because my previous model had an older chip and firmware and they were not compatible. I was prepared to send this one back but the Soundcore rep went above and beyond to help by letting me trade my older version for a new one. WOW! Great customer service. I am certainly a Soundcore fan for life now. I'm a retired audiophile. I've had a lot of expensive stereo equipment in the past with outboard dacs and the whole nine yards. You're not gonna get audiophile quality in a Bluetooth speaker, especially one for a $100 or less. However, what you will get in this speaker is a lot of quality sound for the price. It's definitely worthy of the near 5 star rating. It's a very well rounded speaker with excellent highs, good mids and more than adequate bass. The app is user friendly and helpful in tailoring the sound to your liking. You can add another for stereo and the customer service is, what can I say, excellent. Overall, it's a speaker well worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2023",AHNDQTU7F7JAYMHHRQ2OWALC42SA,True,4,Color: Black

R250K91U05W3UX,B07P39MLKH,3.0 out of 5 stars Great frequency response for size,Pat,3,"Update: Bluetooth on this speaker is the worst. It takes precedence over a connection. Also my husband keeps turning off the connection in the app and if he even touches his phone, even having turned off the connection, it automatically overrides my own Bluetooth connection while I'm in the middle of playing a song. He unpaired permanently and hopefully this will be fixed. But there's the problem of my laptop. I'll be sure to unpair that permanently too. Never pair this thing with more than one device. It blows, because I need to use it with my laptop and my phone for original music projects I'm working on. The app doesn't do anything to help. Bluetooth just needs to die. However, I've not run into this with my little JBL speaker. It will not allow anyone to connect to it when it's currently paired with something else.Of course, my stupid phone has no mini jack output so I can't give up on Bluetooth altogether.Previous reviewI got this as a portable speaker to bring to music composition lessons. I'm composing music on the computer (hobby only) and it was hard to hear the lowest frequency instruments (cello, contrabass so far) on my JBL clip speaker. This isn't as good as studio monitor speakers, but so much more portable. And there's an equalizer in the app.I work on music in a casual hobby band too, and this will be much easier for me to hear the instruments, particularly the bass, in tracks they send me.I usually use very large, high-quality speakers for music listening but don't consider myself an audiophile. This is a Bluetooth speaker that's intended to be a portable convenience and has enough bass that you can hear the bass line loud and clear. The sound overall is crisp and pleasing. If I want the best, I'm not going to get that from a speaker I can put in a tote bag.

RLNPR7VGAQIP3,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars WHOA! Yes, it's all that!",G. Curran,5,"I have an older Altec Lansing BT speaker. It's small, I've had it for a few years, it works pretty well for what it is. I probably paid $60 for it when I got it.I wanted something better, with more bass, better sounds. I don't need multiple speaker set up, or anything like that. I'm a musician, well, keyboard player, and my standard of reference is a pair of KRK Rokit RP-5s. They are very nice, low end monitoring speakers and I drive them from a high end D/A converter. The sound, for me, at 64 years of age, is all that I need.The Soundcore Motion + blew me away with it's sound. I would say that it rivals the RP-5s in clarity and sound discrimination. I did a lot of 'research' on new BT speaker, meaning I watches some YouTube videos, and the Soundcore Motion + always seemed to come out near the top of the pack. I can see why.If you want clear, crisp highs, a wonderful midrange and bass that is clear and accurate (I'm not talking window rattling bass, but bass that sounds like acoustic bass should), then this really is the speaker for you.The free downloadable app for your phone gives you custom EQ capabilities, plus there's an aux in for laptops and such that may not use BT.I am truly impressed by this. I'm also further impressed that by an additional $10 shipping cost, I ordered at 11 a.m. and had the unit here at 6 p.m. The only thing that would have made it any better was if it had gotten here 30 minutes sooner, since I was going out to a party, and it would have worked wonders there.So, if you're on the fence about this speaker, spend the $105 for it. I haven't listened to the Bose or the Sony or the JBL speakers, all of which are probably good speakers, but in the $100 range, I don't think you're going to do too much better than this speaker!

I wanted to like it a lot but the sound quality left too much to be desire for my taste. Even with the app, which allows you to make various adjustments, I could never really fine-tune to my liking. We sent it back and purchased our second Beats Pill +. To each his own.-----------------------------------------------------UPDATE BELOW-------------------------------------------------First The Good: Anker Soundcore Motion+ Bluetooth Speaker delivers excellent sound for the money on a variety of music genres. But I will say that in my specific case I did need to use the EQ, available as an app download, to get my sound to a level that would make this beautiful looking speaker shine. Now about that app,-Once the Anker Soundcore Motion+ Bluetooth Speaker is charged you will want to set up the previously mentioned custom EQ. To do that you‚Äôll have to download the app. To use the Ankers Soundcore App, it does seem to want a lot of feedback which I‚Äôm sure is for future product enhancements. The decision is yours to use it or not. I had no problem.The longer we have used the speaker the more we enjoy the fun that comes with it. From its portable design, sturdy and solid craftsmanship, it‚Äôs built to last. One thing I enjoy is the power button glows white while powered and changes to a blinking red when the battery is low. In this mode, it automatically plays at a reduced volume until plugged in. Once plugged into a charger via the USB-C port, Anker Soundcore Motion+ Bluetooth Speaker increases in volume and continues to play while charging. Nice touch!I was able to get all of my eclectic music to sound very fine-tuned. I especially loved how I could Bluetooth to my TV and have my own personal speaker as to not disturb the neighbors on those late nights.My one issue is that at higher volumes it did tend to distort and I could not find a fix but with many EQ settings at my disposal we were able to come to a happy experience and satisfied with the sound.This is a solid speaker with the potential to sit alongside the BEATS PILL+(which I own) UE BOOMBOX(which I own)and in my opinion, is much better than the Bose SoundLink Mini II Bluetooth Speaker. (which I own)Lastly, the speaker gets 4 stars for quality and price but because Anker is invested in providing outstanding products and customer service then my all-around score is a solid 5.Great Fathers Day gift people.

Pairing 2 speakers in a stereo pair is very easy.The speakers have multiple sound presets and a 9-band EQ configurable via the mobile app. (NOTE: I also bought the Space Q45 NC headphones and used the HearID recommended 8-band EQ settings for configuring the Motion+ EQ.) I absolutely love the sound from the speakers with my custom EQ settings for Rock, Blues, and Metal.I can't speak to the battery life because I bought Anker USB power adapters and all 4 speakers are connected to power 100% of the time.The mobile app is serviceable, but short on extra features. For instance, the app only tracks one pair of the Motion+ speaker pairs at a time. The app has to disconnect from one set to connect to another. Also there is no L/R fader function in the app to adjust the balance between the paired speakers.

While watching almost anything, I cannot pick up any delay in the sound vs peoples lips on screen, a constant problem I've had with earlier Bluetooth devices. I've had identical experiences with my Android phone as well. However my devices are fairly up to date on the Bluetooth standards, and that is likely why they work so well. Experiences will vary if you have a device with older bluetooth equipment in them.I have had no problems with the app, and dialing in the sound for my music. The presets are ok, but really only ok. But after some minor tweaking, it really is as good as advertised. And it can get loud enough for me. When I crank it all the way up, I have to really try to be heard over it, so if you need it loud I think this does a very serviceable job.I haven't run it down to empty yet, but I've used it for numerous hours in a row without issue.

R30CETOJIZVBRA,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent speaker that could use some design updates,Nick Cunningham,4,"This is probably your best option at this price point in the ""large but still somewhat packable speaker"" market. The speaker is slightly larger than a 20 oz. soda bottle laid flat, but much heavier; you could pack this in a suitcase but it's probably going to take up too much room in a carry on or backpack unless you aren't bringing much else. It'll probably do fine in a bag to take to the beach or a cookout. It produces enough clear sound to fill large rooms easily and sounds good with the bass boost activated (and not great without it).I'm docking one star because in an effort to be sleek (and waterproof), Anker sacrificed some ease of use with the button layout. As you can see in the picture above, there are five buttons on the top of the speaker. In short, the buttons are confusing, mushy, and easily show wear.Two of the buttons you are likely using most often, the volume buttons, are the 2nd and 5th buttons in the layout. If you aren't looking directly at the speaker, it's very easy to accidentally hit the Bluetooth pairing button when attempting to turn the volume up, or to hit the center button when trying to turn the volume down. The center button is just the logo, which gives no indication to what it actually does (multifunction play/pause/skip), which is fine if you own the speaker but not great if you ask someone else to change songs. Finally, the buttons have that mushy, silicone feel that makes you wonder if you actually activated it, and despite attempting to clean them, they look very worn after only a few presses. I know that some of this was probably done to improve the waterproofing of the speaker. I have to wonder who the audience is supposed to be, then. Are people taking these into the ocean? Or into their swimming pools at home? Or dancing in the rain?

R25IX1W1BN8S6L,B07P39MLKH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Hit or miss for music, excellent for podcasts. Missing features for the price point.",David Doria,4,"Bought this as an external laptop speaker for when I'm away from home. Tried a couple of tunes right away. Don't Panic by Coldplay sounded great. Some punk songs from NOFX sounded quite muddy. Like I think any average person without a particularly good ear for sound would notice the quality issue.But in reality, I'll mostly use this for stuff like listening to some podcasts or gaming at night before I pass out. Vocals in my fave YouTuber channels sound excellent...arguably even better than my desktop speakers in some ways. Gaming is somewhere between my laptop and desktop speakers, but certainly better than the latter so they serve their purpose as I'm not going to lug around my desktop speakers.For the price should have come with a case, and also a wall charger and USB cord. Comes with none of these.Also a bit of a fingerprint magnet though generally looks and feels sleek.Deducted a star for hit or miss sound quality, and another star for missing features for the price point.EDIT: Apparently supposed to come with a charging cord. The company did contact me separately and send one with an apology credit. Updating to 4 stars.

From its waterproof design to its booming sound, this speaker ticks all the right boxes for me.The waterproof feature has been a game-changer. It's accompanied me to poolside gatherings and beach trips without any worries. And speaking of sound, the volume and audio quality continue to impress. It's loud enough to set the mood for any occasion, and the clarity of the audio never fails to amaze me.What's more, the durability of this speaker has stood the test of time.

The ease of connecting via Bluetooth makes playing music a breeze, and the battery life has consistently kept up with my longest playlists.Overall, my love for this speaker has only grown over the years. It's become an integral part of my daily life, enhancing every moment with its stellar sound and rugged design. If you're in the market for a Bluetooth speaker under 100 bucks that truly delivers on its promises, look no further.

R13LBUHRSCD1IP,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds Better The Longer I've Had It!,DrNik,4,"Update 7/15/2021:Perhaps there was a break-in period on this unit because the longer I've had it the better it sounds even at higher volumes! Since everyone's hearing is different, I really recommend using the Soundcore app on your phone and do Custom EQ settings that sound right to you. I didn't like any of the EQ Presets. So I have officially changed my mind and increased my rating from 3 to 4 Stars. I think this was worth the price and would definitely recommend this BT Speaker.Original From Feb. 2021:I'm a bit disappointed for the price considering it supposed to be 30W of power. Thought I would take the chance since it has separate left and right mid-range and tweeter drivers. There are so many positive reviews and youtube videos comparing this to the larger JBL Charge 4 and others. In my opinion this doesn't sound as good or pack the punch of the smaller JBL Flip 4 or 5. I put the Soundcore app on my phone, tried the BassUp and all EQ Presets. It sounded better with my own Custom EQ settings.It sounds pretty good up to half volume. Going above that and there is distortion in the mid-range and treble, and gets worse the higher it goes. The max volume is tied to my Bluetooth device, and once the max is reached on the device then pressing the volume up on the speaker has no effect. On other BT speakers like JBL & Sony I can increase the volume more on the speakers after the BT sources is at max volume.Listening to quality music is very important to me and 98% of my music library is full CD quality FLAC files. Either I got a defective unit or Anker is putting out a lot of dishonest review and videos. I'm thinking about returning this and going with the JBL Flip 5 even though it has only 1 active Transducer driver. Anker had a good idea here for a compact BT speaker, but it doesn't live up to all the hype.","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2021",AEOUB25MPZ4HGZQTKKUXWTPU5JLQ,True,0,Color: Black
R37HUI3EPME03Y,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Solidly built, great sound, in a perfect package",Sean Mckenzie,5,"I love this thing! First off, I think it looks good. I like that one can see the speakers through the grill, while feeling confident that said speakers are well protected, since themesh is metal not fabric. This will make wiping it down easier, too. I hate fabric speaker covers, they're dust magnets and a pain to clean.The sound: Remarkable! Especially for such a small sized unit. Honestly, it looks bigger in the photos, and it's the perfect size for any shelf or table. The sound is so crisp and clear, yet you can honestly feel the bass, and that's not even with the Bass boost enabled. The Soundcore app is easy to use and gives you access to an EQ mixer, as well as a range of presets. I use the EQ mixer, and you can clearly hear the difference as you adjust. It's also clearly well made. The unit feels hella solid and it's surprisingly heavy, which is a good thing! You're not likely to find great quality sound and quality construction in a plastic, lightweight speaker. This bad boy has a metal body and feels solid AF.My only knock would be that the control buttons on top of the unit are unlit, and the same color (black) as the rest of the unit, making it difficult to see which button is which. But this is really pretty minor, given that most of us will use the soundcore app or our music app, to adjust the controls instead of manually with the hard to read buttons. Also, once you learn which does what, it's a non-issue.I highly recommend this speaker for anyone who wants a high quality portable speaker with excellent sound-for-size/price. You cannot go wrong, and Anker is a quality company with excellent customer service, so you can buy with confidence.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2022",AHQ5345MK2FWM32RKP67X3GAQW2A,True,2,Color: Black

But it‚Äôs about the same, maybe even a little worse. The speaker sounds pretty flat out of the box and you need to use the Soundcore app on your phone to EQ it for a richer, wider sound. This EQ doesn‚Äôt stay when you disconnect from your phone and use a computer (there‚Äôs no soundcore app for windows.) overall the default sound is acceptable but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs speakers out there that sound better for $100 (I got the speaker for about $80 with a sale.)The speaker is also way bigger and heavier than the Boost. The boost is pretty easy to pack in a camping bag or backpack but the Motion is a bit unwieldy and awkward.The upside for this is that the battery should be much better and it is notably louder, but those two perks are irrelevant for my use case and the Boost was loud enough with a good enough battery.If you‚Äôre considering this speaker, I‚Äôd go for the Soundcore Boost instead.","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2023",AGDCVTOYPW4DSRPI3477OGIPO2QA,True,2,Color: Black

R1MLNWUHJKPSH5,B07P39MLKH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Definitely good, but maybe a little overrated",Adrian L.,4,"I purchased this speaker based on all of the hype from Youtube reviewers and other written roundups I've read online. I already have a couple of Bluetooth speakers, but needed something louder to use in a classic car that has a dead stereo system. I also have a Soundcore Wakey alarm clock and was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and volume from that speaker, so I figured this would be similar. Indeed, the Motion+ is a very nice speaker. The ability to adjust the EQ and dial it in is a killer feature that makes this brand and speaker stand out from the pack. Volume is also pretty good. It won't make your ears bleed, but it'll fill a living room.Overall, it's definitely a nice speaker. It feels sturdy and is easy to use. If you're looking for a pounding bass, this isn't the speaker for you. It you're even looking for a deeper, thicker bass, this won't cut it. However, my phone allows me to play music from two Bluetooth speakers at once, so I've paired this with a W-King X10. When I have the EQ on this one with boosted mids and treble, the combo with both speakers playing at once sounds incredible and is almost gets to the point of being too loud for my ears.I have had a lot of issues with pairing this speaker though, which seems to be the biggest downfall. I was able to get it to pair with my phone, but when I try to pair with my computers (I've tried two other ones), it doesn't seem to appear in the available Bluetooth devices. It's very odd and I looked up this issue and it seems to be a recurring issue with this speaker. Fortunately, I requested a replacement from Amazon, so it's on the way (thank you for doing that btw Amazon).

So when I had to go laptop-only for a few months, I decided to try a Bluetooth speaker to make music and movies a little more tolerable. While an Anker user, I have their chargers and power packs and didn't even realize they offered speakers. When I saw several positive reviews of the Soundcore Motion Plus, I figured I would give it a try. I have NOT been disappointed; it is an excellent speaker for what it does! Of course I didn't expect an audiophile-level speaker, but it is surprisingly musical and pleasant to listen to. It can provide some bass boost to fill out the sound at lower listening volumes, which worked well for my situation. I can't speak to the water resistance rating or the 3.5mm aux input but with Bluetooth, I get at least 12 hours of play time before needing to hook it to a charger. For my use-case, it is an excellent speaker!The app? Not so much. I find it tries too hard to belong to the Fruity-Device-User-Culture which hides the real functionality of behind layers and slide menus. It does let you check and update the firmware (if you can find the device settings menu). It does give you some control over the sound signature and even a custom EQ option but I find it a pain to mess with these settings (I leave it on Bass-Heavy and it sounds fine to me). I just turn Bass Boost on and off when I need it. The tiny battery charge level indicator really needs a percentage display next to it. Finally, there seems to be some interference with speaker operation even when the app is ""closed"" and Bluetooth still on. The app has the potential to be useful with the speaker if Anker/Soundcore would put a little effort in refining the app.So why five stars? I didn't really need the app to use the speaker and the speaker is excellent!","Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2021",AFYHWWDTMRCRSFCCJZD4HNU4WS2A,True,1,Color: Black

R3AB2HVXJHPHQK,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Good value for the money!!,Cesar Adrian Alvarez Bautista,4,"It was on sale for $69 at Amazon, so I decided to buy it. That's a very good price, but I played it side to side with my Denon Envaya 250BT, hoping that I would get a better sound overall according to some reviews and the specs. The Anker does sound good with the EQ adjusted, however, the interesting results started to show when comparing at higher volumes (beyond 50% volume). I noticed I was getting some sort of distorsion from the Anker, so, I ran the frequency generator to check the bass extension and then I found the distorsion was caused from the rear radiator, since it has some sort of port that causes the air to overflow and hence produce noise when played at higher levels. On the other hand, Denon bass was nice and clean around the 50-60hz. That easily concluded for me that I was getting a cleaner, higher end sound from the Envaya than from the Anker. Don't get me wrong, the speaker is really well built and I do like the features it has, but does not match the sound you can get from Denon, which is reflected in the price, specially with its tridimensional effect it produces, and without having to adjust EQ to have it sound good. I will return the Anker.EDIT on 1/29/20:I was contacted by Anker directly to my email, and they offered me a free replacement for my speaker in order to make sure I was happy about my purchase and my speaker. I think this is a awesome customer support. Kudos for that!After a more extended listening and having it as my main portable speaker for some time, I can assure this speaker sounds great for the money. The highs, mids and lows are impressive for its size, and I think it's because the neodynium magnets it has, punching beyond its size. I specifically was happier with the mid frequencies on the Anker than the Denon, and also the bass was more noticeable in the lower frequencies. I do think EQing correctly really helps on not pushing this speaker beyond its limits. Based on this I raised to 4 stars but also I KEPT the Anker, which will become my daily speaker for casual listening. I'm glad Anker contacted me, since that made sure I was treated seriusoly by a company that do cares about their customers, which I think is great.Thanks guys!!","Reviewed in the United States December 16, 2019",AFE2KSPVTLZVJMCJD2SOXUJQIDUA,True,1,Color: Black

R3AK5LLZ1VVTWJ,B08X4YMTPM,"5.0 out of 5 stars INSANE Speaker! Quality, volume, battery, and features make this THE BEST!",Jeremy,5,"The JBL Charge 5 is the BEST speaker I have ever owned. I have had the average run-of-the-mill bluetooth speaker that has around a $20 value, for over a year, and I thought it was good sound quality, and I never thought I needed something ‚Äúfancy.‚Äù Well, that speaker started having problems, and I was carefully searching for another speaker. I found this speaker and I thought I would try something new. I only had one thought as I played music out of it for the first time. WOW! The JBL Charge 5 has the best sound quality I had ever heard from a bluetooth speaker. I don‚Äôt ever plan on getting another speaker; that is, a speaker that isn‚Äôt JBL or an upgraded version of the Charge 5. The clarity is absolutely stunning! The bass is DEEP. I can feel the bass through my whole room! The volume is insane. I rarely have it over 50%, but in the event where I need it louder, I turn it up. I once had music filling a whole event center that was quite a reasonable size. If I could choose one word to describe this speaker, it would be ‚ÄúStunning,‚Äù ‚ÄúPowerful,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSupercharged!(Pun intended.)‚Äù On that note, the battery life on this thing is long! I once had the speaker provide some background noise for about two days and the battery life was barely lower than 70% (I think‚Ä¶it‚Äôs hard to tell exactly with the battery indicator; definitely above 60%). Of course, the battery drains quicker when you have the speaker playing at high volumes. Also, it can take some water. Some being a little, I prefer not to put it to the test. Here is my takeaway:DESIGN: 9/10 Great! I love the fabric covering. The JBL logo is made of metal, which makes it look very nice and official. The buttons are easy to distinguish, and the light is on the power, bluetooth, and there is a ring of light around those two buttons when PartyBoost is in effect. There is a battery bar right below the JBL Logo, and it serves as a general battery indicator. You can get the 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. You can get more info on the battery via the app. The weight is surprisingly light, considering the volume this speaker is capable of. Although, it isn‚Äôt the most portable of portable speakers as it is a little big and has a football shape. You can get a case for it that has a strap though. For the skip feature, you have to press the play/pause button twice. Make sure that when you do this, you maintain a consistent interval of time between the two presses. If you do it too fast it will just pause. If you do it too slow, it will just pause then play again.BATTERY: 10/10 Perfect! I absolutely love the battery. I‚Äôm the kind of person that prefers the longest possible battery, and doing whatever it takes to preserve it. I don‚Äôt have to worry much about this battery. Like I said, it has provided some low music for almost 2 days and the battery wasn‚Äôt that affected. However, the battery life will drain much more rapidly when using the speaker at high volumes. I currently use this speaker with a projector to watch TV. I have watched lots of movies and TV shows, and I don‚Äôt have to pay much attention to the battery. I just plug it in every other night, and it does great! And having a battery bank is the cherry on top. I haven‚Äôt used it much, as I keep most of my devices fully charged, but I think it is awesome that it has a battery bank if I need it.SOUND QUALITY: 10/10(10.5/10) Stunning! I didn‚Äôt expect that sound quality could get this good for a bluetooth speaker. JBL means business! When I turn it to high volumes, I can actually feel air blowing from it! On that note, it can go REALLY high in volume. I did not expect that at all. Insane volume. As stated earlier, I use this with a projector, and for all my TV. Watching movies with this speaker makes the entire experience cinematic! A much bigger upgrade compared to the sound TV‚Äôs come with. I would even say that it can contend with some soundbars out there (not the JBL Surround Sound System though‚Ä¶that one seems like the top-tier of JBL). This speaker was my first experience with JBL speakers (other than the car speakers) and I was very impressed. It has been the best sound experience I have ever had. Really clear and crisp audio, and when I say ‚Äúreally,‚Äù I mean truly! When playing music, I can hear every instrument, every breath, and incredible bass. The bass is a superstar in and of itself. Like I said, the bass shakes my whole room when playing music, and when watching movies! The side radiators really, really pack a punch! There is even an adjustable EQ on the app. Though I prefer what the speaker came with. It is a little pricey, (just a little) but know that you get what you pay for! I don‚Äôt think that I can ever go back to what I had‚Ä¶PARTYBOOST: 9/10 Great! I had one, so I bought two more so I could create a surround sound with my TV. It kinda worked. I think I had some sort of connectivity issue, so all I‚Äôll say is that the range might not be that great, so make sure you keep them somewhat close. If you have a projector that has bluetooth and you want to use PartyBoost, I would consider researching what you can do with the Bluetooth latency (As stated earlier, I watch TV with this, and please note there IS some lag between sound and video, as bluetooth will do. However, that is just bluetooth technology, not JBL. Over time my ears and eyes have adjusted, and now it is not that big a deal). In addition to standard bluetooth latency, PartyBoost will make this delay greater (I ended up returning the other two because of this issue). For music, this is not a problem, because it is just sound and no video. With music, PartyBoost is pretty cool! It really creates a much louder and much cooler sound experience. You can even use just two for a stereo effect, and it works great!Overall, this has been the BEST bluetooth speaker experience I have ever had. You better believe I‚Äôll be there for the Charge 6 or 7 or wherever they decide to take this. They really have something good going here. I would 110% recommend this! If you are reading this review, and you would like an upgrade to your typical listening experience, know that this is one of the best out there! And if you catch this at a discounted price, you‚Äôll know you are getting a great deal. JBL has been the best listening experience for me. I will continue buying their products if they keep supplying a high-quality experience. I mean, let the 27,000 ratings with a 4.8 overall rating speak for itself. Here is a simplified pro-con list:PROS-Excellent audio clarity-Excellent bass-Excellent overall sound-Exceptional volume-Long battery life-Battery bank feature-Waterproof feature-Adjustable EQ-Stereo Effect-PartyBoost for multiple speakersCONS-Button timing for the skip track-Could be slightly more portable (We do have the Flip speakers for that though)","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",AEDM32EKQE2HOHUCSXFF2Z27F7NQ,True,67,Color: Black

I first bought the JBL Pulse 5 speaker awhile back, and I really love that one, especially for the light show it can do, but it's a little large to pack up and haul. Then I bought the JBL Flip 6 which is smaller, but still can pack a nice punch... but only if you turn it up really loud. I really love the JBL Flip 6 because it is extremely portable, but I decided that I wanted to try this JBL Charge 5 because I love the camouflage pattern on it, and it seemed like a good in-between speaker from the other two speakers I'm comparing here. As it turns out, the JBL Charge 5 is the best choice for me in terms of portability, and sound. It's got a really nice full sound, and I don't have to turn it up quite as loud as the JBL Flip 6 to achieve the full sound I like. That means to me that I have more volume to play with if I really jam out to some good music. In the future I would like to try the JBL Extreme, even though I know it's not as portable as these other speakers I have. Anyway I really love this JBL Charge 5, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a bluetooth speaker that can get loud, but offers easy portability.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AFE42LBIADDXKHZ66MQRD7DE7JYQ,True,0,Color: Camouflage

R3B50FJN1UU9BC,B08X4YMTPM,3.0 out of 5 stars Audio Engineers point of view,Christo,3,"I purchased two of these to work as a stereo pair in my apartment to obtain a nice full sound without having to really crank the volume to have an enjoyable experience and bother the neighbors.Well it all started out great, the white look clean and are small enough to not take up too much visual space. They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15‚Äô feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to ‚Äústereo‚Äù mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5‚Äôs anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that‚Äôs the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to ‚Äúforget device‚Äù on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AE5UFAYXB2EX2T4NQ5HFHWATP6NA,True,20,Color: White

R1D9I181C4INKE,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speakers,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I‚Äôm old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands‚Ä¶ I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin‚Äôs- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I‚Äôd like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card.

I‚Äôm a die hard JBL guy I put sound systems in trucks with their products and they are awesome. This model was kind of a let down so I purchased a jbl flip 6 same day in person it‚Äôs pretty good and compares to the charge 5 so then I purchased soundcore boom 2 all received with in 24 hours tested all three and I think the boom 2 is better for sound but the charge 5 is better for taking places . I like music when I‚Äôm working so sound quality is important to me. I‚Äôd say skip the charge 5 get a more expensive model or save money get the flip 6 which is like the charge 5 or get good quality in this speaker bracket by getting the boom 2 for 100 bucks. Ps the jbl app to mess with EQ is lacking in customization and barely changes the sounds. Honest opinion I spent a lot of money in 24 hours and I choose the boom 2 this go around.

RHP5S7VJZFNHB,B016QXV2QK,5.0 out of 5 stars Best portable speaker in the 2-300 $ price range. Sound quality is unbelievably sublime.-,shroomshady,5,"Incredible sound quality, easily pairs with Bluetooth devices, charges VERY quickly and lasts SO LONG. It's wonderful. It also has an AUX cable input which is extremely important to me. (Plugging in your device via an AUX cable always sounds better that using Bluetooth.) Turning it on and off makes a really cool vinyl record sound. Turning it on makes a ""Vinyl record starting to play"" sound and turning it off makes a ""Vinyl abruptly stopping"" sound, like the needle has been removed as quickly as possible making a scratch sound. Both sound really cool, that was a really cool surprise, I did not expect it to make those sounds upon turing it on and off. The speaker has some weight to it, which is nice, it feels very well made and IS very well made. It's by far the best portable speaker I've ever owned, I've compared it to the similarly priced BOSE portable speakers, and they sound like garbage compared to this. I cannot stress enough how amazing the sound quality is, and it can get EXTREMELY loud without any distortion. The main thing this speaker is made for is music, but I've watched many films on Blu-Ray and streaming services. All the film audio sounded amazing, so much so that I started using this speaker for everything I watch on the TV in my room. I run the audio that would normally come out of my TV's speakers through this speaker instead. An extremely noticable improvement in the sound of films and television. Only thing I would recommend to anyone who gets one of these Beats Pills is to get a protective carrying case. I found a great protective hardcase that's custom fit for this exact version of the Beats Pill+ for around $10 here on Amazon and everything fits like a glove. Like I said the speaker does have some weight to it so if you're going to be bringing it around with you everywhere, definitely get a case for it. Dropping this speaker could potentially destroy it. Luckily I've never dropped mine so I don't know for sure but the case is a must unless you're just going to leave it in your house. This is an absolutely wonderful speaker in every way, the sound quality is truly amazing. I would highly recommend this to anyone who cares about the quality of sound, of both music and film/television. (Everyone should care about sound quality, but plenty of people don't and just watch and listen to movies/television through their phone's speaker, and actually listen to music the same way, which is just so absurd to me.)Buy this, you will love it! -","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2021",AFD5XPHWP2CFLW5PUCJ7OURU7K5Q,True,5,Color: Black

It sounds great and when i am in the gym with my friends the whole gym could hear the sound like their right next to the speaker. It has a little weight to it and it could get frustrating when you are caring it but in all it is a great thing to invest in. now some people don't like beats or apple or other top brands. But those people do not know what they are talking about. This speaker is outstanding. Especially if you don't have your battery charger that comes with the speaker you can use any lightening charger from apple to charge the speaker. I would recommend this product to everyone. I even bought my cousin, dad, and even my grandma one for christmas and they love it so much. I also hear its really nice to have it in the bathroom with you if you like music while being in the bathroom. It sounds nice and keeps you company. lol. I don't really listen to music that much but i listen to beats 1 apple radio all the time and i can't get over how good the music and sound sounds. the white one could get dirty pretty quick but all it needs is a few while offs every so often. It is also good for audio books as you could be driving or doing other stuff while listening to a book. In all the new beats pill plus is a outstanding product and a must buy for teen agers and other grown adults. i recommend not buying for children under 10 as it is very easy to crack or break or even get wet. They do make cases for the beats pill but you don't really need one. Dr. Dre and Tim Cook are off to a great start in their company and what i am hearing is they have a bunch of stuff planed for 2016 and beyond.","Reviewed in the United States February 29, 2016",AHPKHC24RIWTNSA7T2EZYYMTMERA,True,5,Color: White
R2L1L91BH8GE40,B016QXV2QK,5.0 out of 5 stars Solid Speaker,Cory Drollinger,5,"Ok, so before I bought this speaker I read some of the reviews here and saw mostly positive feedback. I know this isn‚Äôt the absolute best speaker that money can buy but I guess part of me being in my mid 20s rememberers that time when Beats was really cool and holds on to that a little bit. Apple acquired the company and that is definitely evident in this product. The packaging feels very premium as does the speaker. It‚Äôs heavy and feels really good in the hands with a metal speaker grille and a grippy rubber like material wrapping around. It feels like you get what you pay for. Now for the important part. The sound. Again this isn‚Äôt going to blow away anyone who is a ‚ÄúFormer DJ‚Äù or an ‚ÄúAudiophile‚Äù and it shouldn‚Äôt be expected to. This speaker is designed to be used on the deck/patio/garage, etc., it has plenty of volume and as long as you don‚Äôt crank the volume up too high, it has pretty good bass for its size. So maybe for some people the ‚ÄúB‚Äù logo and a relatively decent sounding speaker isn‚Äôt worth 130 bucks and I get that but for me it has the right combo of good looks, good build quality and just enough bass when it comes to my music that made this a good buy for me.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2020",AH5E4PYUC4R7L3TIVQAPMVNHCR6A,True,18,Color: Black

I'm an avid music lover, and this Pill brings it on home in ANY room. Great around the house, and the quality of sound is absolutely AMA-AAA-ZING!!! Family & guests are amazed at the sound, and swear to buy one for their homes. Stick it into a corner (or I read, in a bag) and the sound in amplified and deepened. Connects by bluetooth, and while I have my own music source, I've had guests connect and play their music too. Comes with a lightweight (material) cover, and I understand you can by harder case-covers online. I travel with it, and can't believe how convenient it is. It has a little weight to it, but I don't mind it. I've been known to have it in my pocketbook, streaming music as I shop. Everyone greets me with smiles, and of course, wants to know were it's coming from. Charges quickly & lasts 8-12 hours. (I think it's 12 hours max - but haven't tried it.)

I had wanted one a while but Amazon had the Pill + approx 80$ off so I went ahead and ordered one. I got the special edition (Product) Red. The Pill + came very quick, within two days, on standard free shipping. As with any Beats/Apple product, it was packaged beautifully and securely. Comes approx 80% charged. Very convenient if you have an iphone, as the Pill charges on lightning. Battery life is great, charged it to 100% and listened for about 5hrs and it is on about 75% now. Volume is great, the red looks nice. I am not a composer or a super music snob, but I would say the sound quality is pretty good too. Overall I would say if you can get one on sale, it is worth it, especially if you have an iphone. I would say 189$ is too much for one, if you can get it for about 100$ it is not a bad price.

Not overly ""basey"", but base isdefinitely there, suitable for a portable speaker.It can be turned up LOUD, and sound quality doesn't distort for the most part.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is lack of quality carrying case included.There should be better protection provided for a speaker like this.Cheap dust pouch does nothing.","Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2016",AHBHHSPJKW4P7BIH43UUOYIBNCWA,True,1,Color: Black
R3AVT8DGL3FE07,B016QXV2QK,5.0 out of 5 stars Great successor to the Pill 2.0,tom,5,"The Pill+ is a huge improvement from the Pill 2.0. The sound is just on another level from the previous model. I also love that this one has some weight to it, and doesn't feel like a toy. The fact that I can charge it with the same lightning connectors I have around the house is super convenient. Apple's design influence and attention to detail are certainly present in this. It looks and feels like a premium product.It's very easy to set up, and the battery life is incredible so far.Like others, at this price point I expected this to be the successor to the discontinued Pill XL, which at lower volumes it does sound just as great and fill the room - albeit not as bass-y. But once you crank the volume, there's no comparison to the Pill XL, unfortunately. If you're expecting comparable loudness, bass, and overall sound clarity to the XL at high volumes, might wanna look elsewhere, or hope for a Pill XL+ in the future.The Pill+ is still very good - leaps and bounds above the Pill 2.0 - but still not on par with Pill XL.I'd say it's a good compromise between the big sound of the XL model, and portability of the small model.Overall, I do quite enjoy this speaker and would highly recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2015",AEPU4O34W6X5W6YKSSHNDQT2UL4Q,True,4,Color: Black

R369K085C5P861,B016QXV2QK,5.0 out of 5 stars Definitely better than the Bose SoundLink Color II,Eric,5,"I normally don't write reviews, but I felt that this Product was worth it. Originally I had the Bose SoundLink Color II and thought that it was basically the standard when it comes to portable speakers. The sound quality was okay and it had a weird issue that would require a ""hard"" reset every time it ran out of battery. I figure that was how most portable speakers were, well I was wrong. After I finally had enough of the Bose SoundLink, I decided to try out an alternative portable speaker that was in the same price range. The Beats Pill was only $15-$20 more, the SoundLink is around $99, but essentially in the same price range. After a few minutes of use I was taken aback by the noticeable difference in quality. By comparison the Beats Pill was way better in terms of sound quality, look and working features.I had always been a supporter of Bose's products, however in the portable speakers category, the Beats Pill was a hands down the better product. Because of the easily perceptible differences in quality for something similar in price, I even started questioning whether or not the Bose SoundLink speaker that I had originally bought off of Amazon from Bose was possibly a counterfeit.","Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2020",AFAYG2ZOAEGR5IN6H6T3JEIV6CKQ,True,2,Color: Black

And as soon as I open the balikbayan box (the box from a Philippine carrier who holds this package) I was astonished. Premium Apple packaging (like you see on how the iPhones were packed) Seeing how this product was packed will give you an intro on how well it is on the inside. After I opened it, a silly message was on top of the speaker packaging that says, ""Charge me up before you turn me on."" That message got me excited so I charged it up as soon as got the charger from the box. Minutes later I tried to open it, and voila, a silly sound came up. I synced it to my phone and after I played a song I said to myself, ""Thank you God for this wonderful gift."" That sound, that base, God it's true music to my ears. Maybe others will say, Bose is better, JBL is a beast and less the cost. etc. Well honestly, I've never tried one of those before.

RVX10GZ6G5E45,B016QXV2QK,4.0 out of 5 stars it no longer has that nice grip that the Pill had,Ryan,4,"It's a lot heavier and larger than the original Pill and Pill 2.0. Because of its size, it no longer has that nice grip that the Pill had. It doesn't have an out jack for wireless headphone use like the older ones did. I'm an iPhone user, so I liked how the charger used the iPhone cable, that way I only need one cable when traveling. I dropped it a few times and it held its shape. The paint got scratched off a bit on the grill. Due to the Panadol shape, it's less likely to roll around like the Pill and Pill 2.0 (my 2.0 died when it rolled into my sink of dishes. RIP). The pill is REALLY loud for its size. It hurts a bit actually, but this is totally fine for party situations on the go. Sound quality-wise, it's definitely mixed ""oddly"" in my opinion. I listen to anything from Dubstep, to Pop, to NeuMetal, to Rock, to GlitchHop, to Chiptune, to BeeGees, to Beatles, to Art Blakey, to Anime OPs, to Hip Hop, to Rap.

I bet BOSE has something that sounds at least as good but costs less. Or maybe costs $20 more but sounds twice as good. If you're devoted to Beats, this gets a three star ""it's okay"" rating.

The button to skip forward, play, or pause is too stiff. There is no descernable click or acknowledgedment that the speaker has done what you want, so one will hit the button twice to skip a song, instead only one button press will register and the speaker will pause. So i have to play by pressing once, then skip by pressing twice. The whole evolution goes something like this: I need to skip a song so i press the button twice, only one registers and the song stops. Need to play first before skipping, so hit the button once, song plays, then hit the button twice, tada! The thing you wanted!

R2SSSH04J4J264,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice portable speaker for the price. Solid buy!,Bruce C,5,"Needed a new portable speaker for the home setup and once I saw that Beats (read: Apple) came out with the new Beats Pill, I bit the bullet and purchased one.First things first, the unboxing experience and the design of the speaker is quintessentially Apple. Speaker has a nice heft to it and the design of the speaker is really nice, with the angled design, and the speakers facing you.If you are in the Apple Ecosystem, this speaker was made for you as it connects to your iPhone the minute you turn it on with a very satisfying screen animation. I'm told you can easily connect with an Android product too but I didn't have one in hand to test out how easy it was.The sound quality of this speaker is really great for its size, living up to the Beats name, filling the room with punchy bass and crystal clear sound. Rated IP67 meaning it is dust and water resistant, so you can feel confident taking it to your next beach party or when you are traveling. Battery life of this thing is stated at a whopping 24 hrs. I'll definitely be testing that claim, but if true, is completely mind blowing.But what sets this speaker apart, and one of the main reasons why I bought it, is that it also doubles as a speakerphone!!! I can connect this badboy to my laptop, and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work. And when I'm done with my calls, since it is connected to my laptop via USB-C, I can listen to lossless music on Apple Music. Mind...blown!Run, don't walk, to buy this awesome speaker!!","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFVM53KRAU5JC462ZZDBBKTESPGA,True,9,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Compared to all of them this is an amazing speaker for the price point. Bass is great. Clarity is great. Build quality is great. You can even hook it up via usb c to get lossless music. I didnt notice much a difference that way. Also if your in the apple eco system it works like AirPods where you can switch between devices and also locate the speaker via find my.

The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHAMVBSECCNUJMQV6A3BO3A3HNMA,True,3,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good.

But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I‚Äôm interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it‚Äôs sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It‚Äôs minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don‚Äôt complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it‚Äôs the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you‚Äôll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don‚Äôt even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it‚Äôs kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
RCS6YZDDME20Y,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The Pill punches far above it's weight class!!,Brian Severn,5,"Beats Pill (2024) is a high quality product, from the Apple'esque packaging, to the incredible sound output from this small [tiny?] Bluetooth speaker. Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA,False,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Just something I can set on the shelf by the shower and jam out to without worrying about it getting wet. I misplaced my old one years ago and I always liked the pill shaped form factor.Fast forward to 2024, and we have a brand new Beats Pill that is redesigned from the old model. You still get the pill shape, but now there's some nice updates like the lossless type C listening, improved bass drivers and larger battery capacity...about of days worth of Beats now!The packaging and design are definitely exquisite...it is an Apple product, and it shows in the design and style. There's support for both Apple and Android too which is nice.Sound quality is superb as expected too. Sharp highs and nice thick, booming bass. It definitely leans to a heavier bass sound, which is fine as the end result is still really balanced and crisp.The verdict?

R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

(Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember.

The dual pairing function looks awesome, although not within my use case.Design is sleek and feels solid- but light enough for great portability. The soft touch silicone feels great, although I can foresee being a bit of a dirt magnet, at least on the champagne gold model. The lanyard is a welcome addition, but I do wish it was adjustable- unsure what the point of adding a lanyard is if it cannot be tightened/loosened. USB-C is a great addition, as is fast fuel.Battery life is rated at 24H. Based on early usage, I would believe this to be reasonably accurate. Unit drained about 10% listening to podcasts at ~50% volume.Overall positive first impression.

With a punchy bass and a wide sound stage even for classical/film music, I've enjoyed using them (yes, I got a pair) for music and watching Netflix. The sound quality from stereo pair is absolutely amazing.üîã I love that it is type C fast-charge, and that battery lasts for at least 2-days of normal use; the feature to reverse charge ur other devices is certainly nice but a bit gimmicky in my opinion considering I've never found a scenario to do so.üì≤ It supports airplay and findmy, and I could control it from my Mac, Macbook, iPhone, iPad, and my Apple Watch. A nice convenience feature.The Bad:‚ùå A price tag of $199 CAD (2x HomePod mini) is just not affordable to most, especially for a pair ($398)‚ùå The shape of the pill + the rather hefty weight makes it harder to grab‚ùå Sometimes I'd get the spinny wheel on Airplay for the longest time without connecting to the Pill‚ùå I could not connect to the app for stereo pair at all. The app never ""found"" my Pills.‚ùå You must hold down your fingers on two Pills concurrently to enter stereo mode, not v user friendly.‚ùå With power button serving many functions, I had to learn how many seconds it takes to turn on/off, enter pairing mode, etc.‚ùå The soft rubber surface on top and around the Pill's back attract all kinds of micro dusts and lint.Verdict: While the New Beats Pill delivers incredible sound quality, compatibility, and performance, it is NOT designed with user-friendly interactions in mind. The many little inconveniences will eventually add up to the point you realize it is probably not worth it for its hefty price tag.Alternative: The Bose SoundFlex offers virtually the same features (except for Airplay compatibility), it is more affordable, has a functional in-app pairing/control experience, has an extra speaker grill in its back, and pairs to 2 devices simultaneously while supporting automatic pause/play as you switch between devices.","Reviewed in Canada July 31, 2024",,True,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
