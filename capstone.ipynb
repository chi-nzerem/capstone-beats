The design is sleek and modern, making it a stylish addition to my home decor, and it is super portable, allowing me to take it along for outdoor gatherings without any hassle.

            " 'I have thoroughly enjoyed my entire ownership of this speaker.Time of writing this review is roughly 8 months after purchase, having used this speaker practically every single day since. This was a replacement for a very well-loved but somewhat lacking B&O (P3?) oval-shaped speaker that inspired of few of my must-have features.My key requirements in purchasing a speaker at this price point were:- Punchy, solid bass, with high accuracy, clear playback throughout most of the volume range- Relatively attractive, understated, simple design with ergonomic and intuitive controls- Easily oriented for high quality playback in a variety of different situations (facing sideways, upwards, at angles)- Long-lasting battery without any obnoxious constant playback interruptions informing you of battery life remainingThis speaker delivers on all of these.The bass is incredibly clear, with no horrible warbling and distortion that’s very common with dozens of other similar speakers. The audio playback is very crisp and clear, with no noticeable quality losses. I’m sure it’s not perfect, but it’s more than adequate for 95%+ of people. Even at low volumes, the quality is still extremely high. There is a usable, enjoyable sound at every volume level.The design is simple, but handsome. It does not look obnoxious or out of place anywhere. It is just the right size, not too large to pop into a bag, and not too small as to have low-power drivers with poor sound. Very easy to transport. The squared design makes it very stable on most surfaces, but is still rounded enough not to get caught on things. The controls are very easy to understand, even the multi-device Bluetooth cycling and syncing. I have no complaints.The speaker works well for playback in nearly any position, especially when placed on a table or other nice playback surface. It can be placed facing upward, and the speaker enhances playback for all-around sound. When placed horizontally, the same happens for directional playback. Very impressive stability in a wide variety of situations. Some would consider the lack of a lanyard or string to be a downside for this point, but there is massive benefits to keeping this speaker on a surface.The battery life is incredible. Vastly longer than I had really expected for this speaker. With my personal usage (middle volume range, 2-3 uses a day for 30 to 60 minutes at a time), I usually recharge every 1-2 weeks. Not sure what exactly that equates to in real playback time, but I still find it impressive. The speaker will notify you at 20% and 10% battery level, which is exactly what I wanted. Many other speakers will interrupt playback at 75%, 50%, etc. I’ve not experienced any noticeable battery decay during my ownership, but I have only fully depleted and nearly fully recharged the entire time, with no “filling up” in between.Downsides do exist, but most are inconsequential for me.- The audible indicators that inform you of which device you are connected to can sometimes feel a bit sluggish, especially with long device names.- I feel the price point is still a bit on the high side for the value, but I feel I’ve more than gotten my money’s worth. I just like a good deal.- Volume occasionally spikes very high in certain scenarios when switching between devices, but is fairly easily turned down after a quick scare.I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone in the market for a speaker at this price point. This is an especially good deal on sale. If you’re still reading at this point, just get the damn thing on the way.'\n",
            " \"I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a “party” speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it’s good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there’s even some punch of the bass. It’s so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. 😂So (for now), I’m obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don’t want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It’s made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn’t have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to…2. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it’s on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They’re not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you’ll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The “Used” unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone’s trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled “Refurbished”. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn’t miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I’d like y’all to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you’re blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn’t want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don’t expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won’t be disappointed.\"\n",

            " 'The Goods:🔊 As a Master\\'s student looking for the perfect wireless speaker(s) for my monitor setup, I was thrilled by how good the new Beats Pill sounds. With a punchy bass and a wide sound stage even for classical/film music, I\\'ve enjoyed using them (yes, I got a pair) for music and watching Netflix. The sound quality from stereo pair is absolutely amazing.🔋 I love that it is type C fast-charge, and that battery lasts for at least 2-days of normal use; the feature to reverse charge ur other devices is certainly nice but a bit gimmicky in my opinion considering I\\'ve never found a scenario to do so.📲 It supports airplay and findmy, and I could control it from my Mac, Macbook, iPhone, iPad, and my Apple Watch. A nice convenience feature.The Bad:❌ A price tag of $199 CAD (2x HomePod mini) is just not affordable to most, especially for a pair ($398)❌ The shape of the pill + the rather hefty weight makes it harder to grab❌ Sometimes I\\'d get the spinny wheel on Airplay for the longest time without connecting to the Pill❌ I could not connect to the app for stereo pair at all. The app never \"found\" my Pills.❌ You must hold down your fingers on two Pills concurrently to enter stereo mode, not v user friendly.❌ With power button serving many functions, I had to learn how many seconds it takes to turn on/off, enter pairing mode, etc.❌ The soft rubber surface on top and around the Pill\\'s back attract all kinds of micro dusts and lint.Verdict: While the New Beats Pill delivers incredible sound quality, compatibility, and performance, it is NOT designed with user-friendly interactions in mind. The many little inconveniences will eventually add up to the point you realize it is probably not worth it for its hefty price tag.Alternative: The Bose SoundFlex offers virtually the same features (except for Airplay compatibility), it is more affordable, has a functional in-app pairing/control experience, has an extra speaker grill in its back, and pairs to 2 devices simultaneously while supporting automatic pause/play as you switch between devices.']\n",

            "A few months ago I had an epiphany When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music Today I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker don t tell my dad he would be ashame of me So I started to get better equipment Now I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor so big amplifiers and so are out of the question but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers so I tried the Marshall Emberton II To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement With out of the box settings the sound is more than detailed 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although Peter Cetera s Glory of Love and Toto s Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before they are sharp and strong sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound keywords here really just a little This brings me to my first recommendation do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don t know what you are doing This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings more on this later I have youtube music and amazon prime music yeah I know no spotify and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting Tron Legacy s soundtrack sounded specially dreadful as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat It was a different performance altogether I could ever hear some slight effects they used that I had not noticed before Now one down for the application Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair which was seamless and impressive it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window so it looks cool but the application takes forever to actually discover the device even when it is already paired When it finally discover it which was not too long but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker the application notified me of a firmware upgrade which I proceeded to install The installation failed miserably so I temporarily stopped that effort which I retook successfully a day later The update was surprisingly big in size taking around 5 minutes to download and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with but it went through and after that the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker To end that topic the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming with only three modes Marshall Voice and Push of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality Lesson learned unless too picky when using this speaker leave your apps equalizers on flat their profile is that good Now to the hardware itself people will notice this little wonder Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius and the brass button on top is the cherry on top Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction power volume forward back bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently If we can handle touch control on over head and in ear speakers this button is a piece of cake My only complain in this department is that at least for me an old guy the signs indicating the functions around the button being carved in the black speaker which has texture are for all intent and purposes invisible but once you get accustomed an use the logo as a positional reference that s not a problem anymore And finally the little caveat Single speaker stereo sound Let that sink in Done Ok they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively or was it the other way around well you get my point Stereo suffers a little not too much because both sources are incredibly close but it brings this caveat This speaker should not be set as others against walls like in shelf and so because you end up drowning one side The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage and if you want to appreciate the sound you should point one side not the front or back to you that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price I definitely recommend it Great sound from surprisingly compact unit Full dynamic sound you can feel This is not your typical tinny speaker box this is a micro boom box Doesn t hurt that it s so attractive either Large rooms with high ceilings will present a challenge but for a small to medium sized office it s perfect Wow This tiny portable speaker packs a punch I am by no means an audiophile So don t know the technical jargon to describe it but I could hear the minute instrument details and crisp sound The bass is enough for me and the sound fills a small room The battery life is great and is portable enough to take it anywhere Really glad I didn t get the larger one which would no doubt sound great but would not be small enough to take it anywhere Feels churlish to give just three stars 3 5 imo So to the point I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom Easy seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit I really didn t need to look at the instructions with that Smooth use there To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic The sound quality for music is fine ish considering the size of speaker It s fine for background music if you re flexible on sound quality as long as you don t play loudly at that point the music will frazzle out So limited not surprising Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone s speaker and in line with the price point in general I think it should be about 25 less The app is useless I guess I expected something from the app I m at a loss for the point of it I tried it out on my phone It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on Even as I was literally playing music through it I did all the stuff Restart reconnect etc Reviewed the booklet Nothing Everything re the speaker and phone working fine But what is the point of the app I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features Maybe bass and treble controls The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off lolFine retro look sturdy small footprint and working out for podcasts Do not think the app is or will be helpful If I were to try another I d probably go with the Klipsch of similar design It s approximately 50 more but better sound and working app Remove 25 dollars off price on the Em II and it s a fair deal It s good but it does not hold the 30 hours with good sound volume The sound is crisp but the volume is not loud enough I bought the charge 4 from jbl three years ago and it still works great I gave it away tho so I was looking for another speaker I ve heard Marshall s bigger speakers before and went and tried with this one but the volume isn t as loud as one would think I m keeping it because it has a good look and because I can use it as a daily for the shower But if you re looking to throw a little party or going to the pool with friends I would recommend a different option This speaker really amazed me the sound it produced with such a small footprint I was looking for a speaker I can travel with and was very impressed upon arrival With sound coming from both sides I was really amazed of the quality it produced Do not expect earth shattering bass from this unit but good quality sound with ease of portability Get one you won t regret it What I liked most about this unit was the dual driver system where you can get a more stereo sound than other Bluetooth speakers that are more mono unless you pair a few together The battery lasting up to 30 hours is impressive though I didn t just it more than a few hours and couldn t speak to what real time is The top metal multi directional button is very nice and premium feel however the textured top rubber surround makes reading the Volume Track directions virtually impossible to see you get used to it but it would be nice if they were a little more visible I will say that I m disappointed in 2024 we re still seeing devices with Bluetooth 5 1 considering that it was released in 2016 and 5 3 has been out since 2021 With the driver s front and back firing I found that I got a wider sound by turning the unit sideways so that I was looking at the side of the unit while the drivers fired left and right I listen to just about anything and other were songs where the speaker excelled but then others where it sounded very flat and it s because of the inconsistency that I returned it I will say that I liked it much more than the JBL s that I tested against which had almost zero depth comparatively but for a little more I got something that while larger has a better sound presence I was tempted to keep this as an alternative but I think over time I would probably get annoyed with some songs sounding flat and others very deep and rich or course tracks and recording quality matter but compared to other speakers I tested I didn t see as big of a swing between the same songs Yes the external design of this speaker is awesome with the black and gold design bringing back memories of yesteryear No only does this speaker look cool it rocks out At any volume level it sounds great to me I have had lots of small speakers Bose Jambox etc and this one sounds the best I have not used it in multi speaker settings and I wish the app would let me adjust the equalizer a little bit I just got my little Marshall speaker and I am so happy I went with this one The look and feel of this speaker is just superior The sound is amazing It even has bass This has definitely made me want to get the home speaker I love this speaker I can t believe the sound from a small box Highly recommend It s got great sound and the battery life last a long time We keep it in our car and whever we are outside enjoying park kids play or even at my parents and they don t have good speakers we take it out and play some music I visited a friend on Florida recently and he s building a new house We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails it won t be done until May 2024 and brought along his Bang Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water I don t seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker but I was very impressed with the B O speaker It rocked I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself These things aren t cheap the good ones anyway so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales The B O software that enables you to pair with their speaker was a pain in the neck They were hounding me and sending me e mails and all the rest I wanted another alternative I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge I think I got it on sale for around 120 when all was said and done It showed up two day later I pulled it out of the package charged it up and paired it with my phone Hate me or them but the first song I played with Help On The Way Slipnot from Blues For Allah Grateful Dead Wow Absolutely loved the sound and the look Down the road I will look into either stacking another one they have that ability or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting but right now this thing rocks If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music this is for you I m impressed I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice That doesn t appear to be the case but it s plenty loud enough in a vacuum It s a starter speaker so I don t expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes but I m very satisfied short term Buy with confidence Its awesome looking as being addicted to concerts P When I get the chance I will stack them lol But for now I get distortion when the vol is max However this is my first mini BT speaker and I may need the app they have to fixit My battery runs down to like 40 after playing 85 vol for about 4 hours so not to bad imho I saw the reviews and was a little skeptical of all the high ratings but I was immediately surprised by the bass along with it still balancing the high notes Great speaker especially for the price I loved this Marshall speaker I needed it for my bedroom so I could hear my music on my cell phone I have Spotify and enjoy my choices indoors now Thank you Can you say awesome This is my second Marshall speaker They are fantastic Great sound and great price We ve used it a lot will consider for gift giving at Christmas Love it A lot of sound for a small box Packs great sound for its size and sounds great Use it mainly for work A great speaker that puts out a solid sound Got a couple a compliments on how the speaker looks Would give it 5 stars but the app doesn t work Hopefully they will get that fixed soon I ve used many but Marshall s products are another level for its sound n look quality Easy to carry for travel I bought 7 of them so far The speaker has a great design and appearance and I particularly like the control buttons However it s disappointing that it comes with outdated Bluetooth technology and lacks AirPlay support Additionally the speakers seem unreliable I use it everyday battery lasts a really long time without recharding great sound and if you have other marshall speakers you can connect them so the music sounds even louder Great product Perfect for my room The speaker I purchased from Marshall brand through from Amazon I m thoroughly impressed with the sound quality and the bass is exceptional The clarity and depth of the sound are top notch I m thoroughly enjoying listening to music on this speaker Great product I have all sizes This is impressive Style and sound in a small top notch speaker Highly highly recommended So cute portable and good sound quality Great product with satisfied quality The media could not be loaded Very pleased Very nice speaker Premium quality Very pleasant to the touch on the outside it is covered with a kind of soft and pleasant rubber that hugs the skin I think the cream version is the best Very smooth and clean sound It has 2 speakers on each side one for low sounds and one for high sounds The classic look gives it priority This has 20w JBL has 40w but this looks great and for the room it is enough Had difficulty traveling with an Echo dot so grabbed this as it is much more portable with a crazy battery life and great sound It jams This is the bluetooth speaker I have been looking for Great sound reliable connectivity and easy to set up and use and it looks cool Could not be happier with it Battery life is as expected long lasting Value for money Sound quality is amazing Big sound from a small speaker I def recommend Like everyone else for the price you don t have high expectations came in ten minutes ago already charged didn t have to have my kids to help me haha Already rocking out to some Black Sabbath This ll be a perfect little job site sound system Thank you for this good product I actually had to return this because I am using it to make the alarms louder on my boat navigation system but it will go idle if it doesn t have an audio input so I needed to replace it for a speaker that would remain active as long as it was plugged into power But it has the best sound of any system I ve seen Superb bluetooth speaker from Marshall As you would expect the sound quality is awesome and the battery life is amazing I think most people will be happy with this speaker I waited a few battery cycles to write this review I am VERY pleased with this speaker The sound is crisp clear and loud with a long lasting battery I own several bluetooth speakers and this one by far is my favorite You will not be dissapointed We have a number of blue tooth speakers even a nice JVC but this one tops them all its our choice every time now This is a great speaker It has speakers on both sides The bass doesn t vibrate the speaker but the air around it Make sure to change the settings in the apps equalizer from classic to push It ll make the vocals more pronounced Battery life is amazing I d say it s on par with Bose but better battery This speaker is everything Aesthetically pleasing I mean the speaker is gorgeous Feels super high quality and the sound is just amazing It s a little pricey but you get for what you pay for Highly recommend perfect for its category It paired to my galaxy s23 1st try and right away Great sound for it s size I am pleased Me and Marshall go way back so when I was searching for a portable speaker I kept coming back to this one Even though my daughter kept telling me to get a JBL I love the look of this little Marshall classic But I probably should have listened to my daughter The sound is decent to good There is no ability to toggle any sort of EQ So the sound you hear is the sound you get The thing that I like least about this speaker is the function button There is only one that you depress in N S E and W for different abilities but it is loose It wobbles around like a loose tooth I would prefer a nice tight button that snaps in each direction This has caused me to slip and call the wrong function and it just feels wrong This speaker is on par with a bose Sound is clear and crisp even at higher volume Full room filling sound Highly recommended So good I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton As wanted I pair them together to get surround sound smaller size and save about 50 Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I m taking with me to Heaven at that time it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers That s because I already own a pair of off brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats Bose Sony etc They have all the other bells and whistles specifications including USB C rapid charging 20 hours playtime and only cost 30 each The seller stopped selling them on Amazon Emberton II was a huge jump in price The difference from Emberton I is it will pair with other Marshall speakers But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs Also the Emberton II has a grain texture finish The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products Knock offs provide knock off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews I won t describe the differences in great details The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides It looks and feels real money very expensively printed Inside packaging and booklets too The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid The grills are finished very well individually without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem Look closely The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres It s a work of art pumping out sound spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices to hear them together in one song This is studio quality at a reasonable price It exceeds my 30 pair which already beat out all the other more expensive speakers in the only way it could I heard sounds playing in music I ve heard so many times I can replay it verbatim in my head Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison But if I m completely satisfied at 30 or 170 no one can entice me to spend 1500 or 15 000 I can afford to pay too I might purchase more Emberton II s to install wireless speakers throughout the house For now I m pretty satisfied Size really doesn t matter and in the world of speakers it s the sound that counts not the inches Traveling 90 of the time I was tired of jamming things in my ears or feeling like I had a sauna on my head with over ear headphones I ve tested the heavy hitters B O Sonos Bose Megaboom more like Mega Joke Anker and had almost thrown in the towel Then a friend introduced me to the Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker claiming it s as good or better than his fancy B O speaker but less than half the price Now when I saw the Marshall speaker s price tag at 128 00 I hesitated I mean I ve been forking out 250 00 and more for other speakers But curiosity got the better of me and boy am I glad it did The Marshall speaker not only shattered my expectations with its deep bass and distortion free music even at volumes that could make my ears bleed I m a convert and already planning to surround myself with more of these pocket sized wonders Cheers The toggle n mode is perfect it s intuitive and makes the whole thing enjoyable I bought this and the Bose Flex Soundlink Performs well and has good battery life I liked Bose better because it does bass better Although this one has stereo sound Best sound for the size and price Love the sound quality and form factor Smaller than expected but excellent sound quality The speaker delivers an impressive audio experience with its stunning sound quality and appearance The batteries are long lasting and despite its compact size it definitely pleases with its loud output Android users just say no The sound is very good and it feels like a heavy well built product I bought this for my husband who will only ever buy an Android phone but this device does not work with an Android He is keeping it because he can use it with his computer but he is disappointed He has a Marshall amp for his guitar He loves Marshall I just checked the stats worldwide there are 3 billion Android devices to 1 billion iPhone Seems like plenty of reason to get the app fixed so Android users can use their beloved Marshall The quality of the speaker is great very elegant and it sounds beautiful However compared to other speakers I have bought this does nothing but just Bluetooth play I am very disappointed because I was under the impression that it would play from SD card USB port and auxiliary port Other speakers cost less have those features and sound as good This is an amazing speaker with excellent sound quality that surpassed expectations and competitors The lower rating is due to the speaker s inability to go to a really low volume that I wanted for it to be a low key speaker for the bedroom Also Marshall allows pairing of speakers to play the same sound or in stereo but that apparently is only for when you have two of the same speakers I have one of their larger speakers that I love so I was very disappointed that their app doesn t allow pairing of two of their speakers that aren t identical If you don t care about really low volume music or pairing with a different Marshall speaker I can t recommend this more highly Very good full bodied sound It feels much bigger than it is It has enough gut to fill mid to big room with qualitative sound Very enjoyable listening Though the companion app is almost useless doesn t have equalizer and doesn t work on Android 14 It s rare for me to spend this kind of money on any Bluetooth type device simply cause it s usually impossible to justify such an expenditure when there are so many other more important expenses However a dude that tried got dealt the friend card before I came along to my gf left this exact Marshall bt speaker in her car I understood why he was hounding her for it back So even though he loathed me for landing the girl I made it a point to return his speaker to him ordered one of my very own immediately after Yea I coulda just kept his but after hearing that thing I instantly knew understood how much he valued that speaker Also knowing it was worth the money I really didn t mind just buying one for me Hopefully this little story can convey how highly I rate this speaker Maybe Bose is it s only real competition but they ugly compared to this one All the other brands this thing smokes Hope this helps someone out there This item is an exceptional piece of technology the sound is crystal clear and powerful the interface is simple and effective and the build is rock solid But alas It s got no mic hence no speakerphone capabilities This means that if someone calls you or you want to interact with your phone at all through voice you will have to get your rear end to your phone and do it through the phone which will sound like a motherboard speaker after listening to the Marshall Remember you have an HD sound device connected to your phone literally in your hand If this was a purposeful decision by the design team then they really messed up what could have been a perfect product I wonder what was going through their minds For me this is a deal breaker I have zero complaints with it just wish I would have bought it sooner Battery life is good based trouble Bids are all there with plenty of volume for golfing discgolfing or casual use I haven t found anything to dislike Sound is very good and it s surprising given its small footprint This gets nothing but accolades as it s a wonderful product Overall soundstage is muted but I listen at low to mid volumes so it s not much of a concern I purchased it primarily because of its aesthetics Build quality is beyond reproach Love the compact design and solid feelNo regretsUPdate 07 24 24 Recently an annoying problem has surfaced I have 2 Embertons and when in Stack mode one would intermittently drop from Stack mode while the other would continue playing I would then have to double press the Bluetooth button on the non playing speaker to reconnect to the Stack mode I still love the sound and attractiveness of the Embertons but would have probably chosen different speakers had I been aware of this failing I bought this as a gift for my girl and she likes it so much This one has very vintage look and the material feels high level I know this may not be very important for a speaker normally But this one can be a great decoration or fashion accessory For the sound itself it s decent a little less detailed but very good overall balance Recommend to anyone want good sound with style Not much to say I looked up a lot of models and decided to try this based on the price and other reviews I am very happy with it Good battery great texture pretty good sound and it s small Would like to return it I love the design of this speaker though I did wish it had some kind of carrying handle The sound is excellent for the size and the battery life is great I bought it on sale but I do feel the regular price is a little on the expensive side Even with that you can t go wrong with it The sound quality is absolutely exceptional delivering rich clear audio that fills the room effortlessly Whether I m listening to my favorite music catching up on podcasts or enjoying movie nights the speaker amplifies every sound with incredible depth and clarity The design is sleek and modern making it a stylish addition to my home decor and it is super portable allowing me to take it along for outdoor gatherings without any hassle Setup was a breeze and the Bluetooth connectivity works flawlessly with my devices I even got a cute matching accessory holder to carry it like a handbag Worth the money I have thoroughly enjoyed my entire ownership of this speaker Time of writing this review is roughly 8 months after purchase having used this speaker practically every single day since This was a replacement for a very well loved but somewhat lacking B O P3 oval shaped speaker that inspired of few of my must have features My key requirements in purchasing a speaker at this price point were Punchy solid bass with high accuracy clear playback throughout most of the volume range Relatively attractive understated simple design with ergonomic and intuitive controls Easily oriented for high quality playback in a variety of different situations facing sideways upwards at angles Long lasting battery without any obnoxious constant playback interruptions informing you of battery life remainingThis speaker delivers on all of these The bass is incredibly clear with no horrible warbling and distortion that s very common with dozens of other similar speakers The audio playback is very crisp and clear with no noticeable quality losses I m sure it s not perfect but it s more than adequate for 95 of people Even at low volumes the quality is still extremely high There is a usable enjoyable sound at every volume level The design is simple but handsome It does not look obnoxious or out of place anywhere It is just the right size not too large to pop into a bag and not too small as to have low power drivers with poor sound Very easy to transport The squared design makes it very stable on most surfaces but is still rounded enough not to get caught on things The controls are very easy to understand even the multi device Bluetooth cycling and syncing I have no complaints The speaker works well for playback in nearly any position especially when placed on a table or other nice playback surface It can be placed facing upward and the speaker enhances playback for all around sound When placed horizontally the same happens for directional playback Very impressive stability in a wide variety of situations Some would consider the lack of a lanyard or string to be a downside for this point but there is massive benefits to keeping this speaker on a surface The battery life is incredible Vastly longer than I had really expected for this speaker With my personal usage middle volume range 2 3 uses a day for 30 to 60 minutes at a time I usually recharge every 1 2 weeks Not sure what exactly that equates to in real playback time but I still find it impressive The speaker will notify you at 20 and 10 battery level which is exactly what I wanted Many other speakers will interrupt playback at 75 50 etc I ve not experienced any noticeable battery decay during my ownership but I have only fully depleted and nearly fully recharged the entire time with no filling up in between Downsides do exist but most are inconsequential for me The audible indicators that inform you of which device you are connected to can sometimes feel a bit sluggish especially with long device names I feel the price point is still a bit on the high side for the value but I feel I ve more than gotten my money s worth I just like a good deal Volume occasionally spikes very high in certain scenarios when switching between devices but is fairly easily turned down after a quick scare I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone in the market for a speaker at this price point This is an especially good deal on sale If you re still reading at this point just get the damn thing on the way I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard I had no expectations of it being a party speaker or anything of the like But my goodness This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim They say it s good for less than 10 people Probably true if in an enclosed space Outside standing in the corner of my backyard about 40 feet away the speaker volume is at about 60 70 and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker and the vocals are clear the instruments are clear and there s even some punch of the bass It s so much more potent than I expected I actually bought a second one the one pictured so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode and then these are far better than they have any right to be The bass shook through the house at about 40 volume to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day So for now I m obliging and returning one but honestly I don t want to One of these speakers are great Two make a great portable stereo system Now for the feature set Key selling points for me were 1 Durability It s made of steel and silicone is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust You can enjoy this in the yard on your workbench swimming shower etc I live in high desert and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn t have a single dent or scratch Which leads me to 2 The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning so the sound quality was maintained even if it s on its back side or face down None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge 3 Unlike other products that I considered this sounded good right out of the box Anker Soundcore offers some great competition in this segment but needs the EQ tweaked to shine They re not bad by any means but I wanted things to just be simple Power on and go without fuss Bose delivered that There are similar products for sure Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did We already covered Soundcore Tweak with the EQ save some money you ll likely be happy These speakers do often go on sale and I purchased mine used like new and refurbished respectively The Used unit was actually brand new from Amazon broke the seals on the box and everything Far as I could tell the speaker just rolled around in someone s trunk unopened before returning The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents broken seals and all accessories were obviously also unopened Refurbished unit came straight from Bose Also came with all accessories and literature just a box that was labeled Refurbished Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless I bring this up to encourage you to save some money reduce some e waste and buy secondhand like I did No judgments if you want to go new of course But I got 2 speakers one that was new in reality essentially 100 off the set and I didn t miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty 150 is pricey for a speaker but 103 for a Bose speaker is not Especially one that can literally go for a swim Four criticisms I d like y all to know First compression above about 75 volume Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole In reality that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile No big deal unless you re blasting EDM Hip Hop the like As I said this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70 was more than enough to fill my backyard Second criticism is no biggie for me but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition I didn t want to fuss with an EQ but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound Consequentially the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode not required Third criticism is truly a nitpick but why do I have two apps for my Bose products Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app You could easily knock out criticisms 3 4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app like my QuietComfort Headphones and this VERY speaker s big brother the Soundlink Flex Max is already there Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music with a basic EQ like the others Fourth this uses outdated Bluetooth No big deal Pairs easily But don t expect to watch movies or game off of this Latency is too high Anyhow enough of that Go buy one Or better yet two You won t be disappointed I m absolutely thrilled with this speaker The color is spot on and the material feels soft yet is easy to clean The sound quality is impressively good which was a wonderful surprise You can position it on its side for directional sound or lay it flat for excellent all around audio clarity Its size is perfect for placing on a desk counter or even packing in your luggage The audio is clear and crisp and it s waterproof making it ideal for use in the shower Charging is straightforward with a USB C connection just like most of my other devices The buttons are soft yet durable So far I haven t found anything to dislike about it This is by far the best portable speaker I have ever owned The sound quality is immaculate with a bass that is incredibly smooth and buttery I love it so much that I brought it with me to a small gathering Even in a pretty large room it played music beautifully and people were impressed with the sound Overall this is a great speaker It exceeds my expectations in terms of performance and sound quality If you re looking for a reliable and impressive portable speaker I highly recommend this one As always Bose sound quality is clean and crisp can hear the notes the base is alright It doesn t take long to charge It connects fine to all my devices The color is nice pastel purple I would need to using it for couple of months to see how durable it is but it s sturdy and the price is good especially when on sale Got this lil thing for Prime Day for only 99 I m not going to lie I had low expectations and planned on returning it After opening it and setting it up I got to see what the hype was about Took me a couple hours of listening to figure out if it was a bang for my buck or a waste of money I currently have the first UE Megaboom that I use daily that I bought back in 2016 It s loud has bass and can fill a room Sadly the charge isn t exactly reliable so I was looking for something new The Bose Link Flex definitely has a great quality sound It will definitely fill a room I like to use mine in the shower and acoustically in the shower the bass just sounds amazing Speaker actually fell off the shelf from the bass and survived the fall Now I listen to just about every genre of music I found it to sound best with Latin music Vocals are super clear When it came to rap music or music with lots of bass I found it to sound perfectly balanced when the volume was at about 75 Above that you ll definitely still get volume but the bass will take a seat back I m used to the UE Megaboom that has 360 sound While the Bose Link Flex will fill a room the sound seems more straight forward depending if you want to stand it up or lay it down Bose App is decent Doesn t really have any equalizer setting on there if that s what you re loooking for I got this because it is small enough to pack in a carry on and not take up too much space in my bag Might I add it s almost the same size as my iPhone 14 Pro Max I can easily carry both in one hand Easy to say I m going to keep this speaker with me Now let s see if the battery life is legit I ll check back in Good sound quality for what it is Very good build quality The green version is really nice looking Other versions are probably nice too I opted for the green dark green it is Yoda Rubberized back top bottom seamless rubber shell backing Weather damage proofing Buttons integrated nicely into top rubber shell with tiny white visible LEDs for power and Bluetooth Charging works great I haven t counted the hours but it last a good long while Satisfying You can use it while it s plugged in OMG this is the best speaker which is not a huge floor speaker over 1 foot high that is part of a massive speaker system The sound quality is truly impressive for a speaker of any size I think that if I bought another one which I m seriously considering it would rival my Kenwood stereo system which has two floor speakers that are over a foot high each the Kenwood amplifier the Kenwood 5 CD player All that stuff is so big that it needs its own cabinet takes up several feet of floor space I don t know how the geniuses at Bose have done it but they have somehow packed all that sound into a speaker less than half the size of a loaf of bread that is also a very appealing shade of lilac that goes with my décor The Bluetooth connection works perfectly every time even though I don t have the newest phone out there I m so in love with this speaker the only complaint I have is purely aesthetic easily fixed the fabric loop attached to this beautiful lilac speaker is for some unknown reason an entirely ridiculous shade of brilliant orange which clashes hideously with everything I solved this problem with a dark purple Sharpie marker That is the only complaint I have While this speaker comes without any instructions on how to set it up the set up is so easy even when you re not a technology person that I set it up myself with no help in under a minute I plugged it in turned it on turned the volume all the way up for some idiotic reason it comes with the volume all the way down then turned on the Bluetooth on my phone had it search for Bluetooth devices My phone found the speaker very quickly paired with it without issue started playing One important thing to know is that when you leave the range of the speaker for an extended period of time like when I leave for work take my phone with me the speaker will turn that connection off so that when I get home want to use my speaker again I need to go over to the speaker with my phone push the power button once The speaker will say how much battery power is left that it is now connected to my phone I don t turn the Bluetooth off on my phone when I leave the house I recommend turning the speaker all the way up then controlling the volume through your phone which is what I do I think that s the easiest way to do it One charge of the battery lasts a long time at least 12 hours so that part s great as well Just buy it already you won t regret it It ll beat the pants off of all of your other speakers even if you already have a nice set of Bose speakers Bought this for work I run a forklift and JBLs just arent loud enough and was pleasantly surprised by how loud it gets Sound quality is fantastic at all volume levels its durable and holds up pretty well to the elements The battery does genuinely last a full 8 10 hour shift playing constantly A few things to note however There are no EQ controls for it Sound is well balanced but theres no bass boost treble no nada built in The app is unnecessary once you get it set up with your device really only need it to check the battery The speaker will tell you what its battery percentage is if you turn it off and on though Max volume is entirely dependent on the device its paired to If i pair it to my PC max volume is pretty quiet If i pair it to my buddy s phone it gets pretty loud but nowhere near as loud as it is paired to my phone Volume controls are independent from the device and speaker You can turn your speaker volume to max but your device is the primary control So if you have the speaker on low volume and your phone all the way to the max it wont be as loud as both at max and vice versa Its very odd It does not remember the bluetooth volume of the device its paired to so if you turn it off and use it the next day it has a habit of being at full blown volume by default Just be mindful Other than that its excellent and no one will be disappointed by it You may have trouble getting this to play sound from you desktop computer as I did The unit misleads you by saying you need to download the app Bose connect I tried to but could not get it to download from the App store or from the Bose website Other Bluetooth speakers connected automatically for me so this was a hassle I tried to chat with the Bose help bot but it was of no help the lady on the phone at Bose tech support was of no help and disconnected mid sentence and didn t call me back I tried to return the item on Amazon then saw a troubleshooting video Open your systems settings on your computer and select sound click the Bose option for speaker output For some reason this Bose unit doesn t default as the output as other Bluetooth speakers did on my computer Then you should be able to hear it Bose has been one of the gold standard in sound for decades So it s not surprising that they pack a lot of quality into this little speaker For one thing holds a charge a long time And it announces each time it s turned on how much charge is left No guessing The sound quality is really decent for the size of the speaker It can get very very loud if that s your thing It has a bass booster that I usually leave on I appreciate that it is water resistant as I take this into the bathroom the kitchen camping etc It paired readily with my iPhone There are some other features I haven t played with yet like doing my Teams meetings with it using the onboard mic but I suspect it will be fine If you are looking for a reasonably small Bluetooth speaker with a big sound without breaking the bank give it a try This Bose speaker does not disappoint The sound is crisp and clear and I love the bass levels when that bass kicks in it becomes a full on party The color is perfect as it fits all of my periwinkle lavender color schemes I had no problem connecting my phone and my MacBook Air to the Bose app I did have to go into my settings and change the output to the Bose speaker but other than that the connection is flawless I recommend this speaker to anyone who wants superb sound on the go or stationary Oh and it holds a charge for quite some time I love how it lets me know how much charge I have remaining and which device it connects to when I turn it on This is a fun product and also use it for my massage work it really is a handy tool as well This is our 4th Bose speaker that we ve purchased I bought this one to replace my Bose soundlink color 2 speaker that stopped working after a few years I m so glad I purchased it It has waaaaaay better sound quality than the soundlink color 2 model I was ecstatic when I plugged it in and heard how awesome the bass is and the volume level it goes up to is great I m excited to take it to the beach and the pool I just received it in the mail today and wanted to let others know how great it sounds Hopefully it lasts awhile Buy it You ll love it I just ordered a hard case for it to keep the charging cord with it and to protect it when I pack it in my beach bag and suitcase when traveling I love the stone blue color I highly recommend this Bose flex speaker I LOVE these Bose speakers I got two so I could do stereo sound It has a party setting also I have a wraparound porch so it stretches the sound out nicely I like the rubber cover because I use them outside a lot It was easy to pair it to my phone and to pair up the second speaker Just follow the instructions provided This was a great investment because I m all about music and good sound I even listen to my podcasts using them You can adjust the speakers either by the controls on the speaker or by your phone which is really convenient Even if I m talking on the phone and want the conversation heard it can come across the speaker The USB C charger cord comes with it It charges very quickly I like when you turn it on it tells you what the battery level is at and where it is paired to These are the best little speakers with a huge sound that I have ever had But then it s a BOSE The loop on the side makes it possible to hang the speaker easily too That s especially helpful outside on the porch where I have a number of hooks for hanging plants I don t have to worry about its stability although it has a nice balance of weight to it just to sit it on a railing If you like what I described you will want to own one or more It s worth it I ve had a few different bluetooth speakers and this one is by far the best My last one was okay but had annoying flashing disco party type lights that took 6 pushes to turn off It was hard for me to finally decide to replace since nothing was wrong with it it just irritated me This one has the best sound of all my speakers easy use buttons easy to set up Has automatic shut off which is a plus in my book Basically you get what you pay for and this is worth it This speaker is really good for listening to Audiobooks Works well for casual party music by the fire outside Works well for garage time working on motorcycle or truck I would say if you want a super bass speaker this is not it This is decent Even for my ears which I am hard at hearing It s a nice looking speaker Not too heavy I use it mostly in the kitchen while I cook It s probably a 4 5 there is much better speakers in the market But not for that price It is a mono speaker on the right and a Support speaker on its left If I could have changed anything about the speaker I would design it to be stero speaker But I suppose I could just buy another and pair them together to get stero I use this mostly with my digital TV It connects by bluetooth automatically I have it by my livingroom chair and can hear my TV perfectly over all the apartment noises The bass is amazing for such a small speaker much better sound than the TV It is my second one as I gave my first Bose speaker different model to my mechanically minded son thinking it was broken He figured out it was the charging base it sat on and not the speaker that was broken He plugs it in directly like this one to charge and it works perfectly despite being 9 years old It was on sale It was purple It was Bose Those were my reasons for purchasing despite the reviews complaining about the voice prompts I used the Bose Connect app to set it up but I deleted the app afterwards It was always saying the speaker disconnected even though it was still playing The app let me turn off the voice prompts Then I found the actual user manual online and discovered an alternate method Press and hold and simultaneously until you hear Voice prompts off It sounds pretty good but I mosty use it for voice It doesn t matter how it is oriented it still sounds good But the material that it s made of is messy It picks up dust and dog hair way too easily I am trying to find a good way to keep it clean I think it s going to work well for me I listen to a variety of music from Country to Rock The acoustics of this Bose is spot on All instrumentation comes though nicely while the vocals are crystal clear The drums of In the Air Tonight the guitar solo of Comfortably Numb and the vocals in Bohemian Rhapsody want for NOTHING Half volume is more than enough for me in our lounge with the speaker on the far side of the room I am a bit Technically Challenged but pairing the speaker up to my iPhone is a breeze I can recommend without hesitation My wife asked for another product for her birthday but she saw this speaker on line She came to me and said I know you ordered XXXXXXXXXX but I m pining for this and is there any chance you could cancel that and get me this I said the item couldn t be returned but I ve got a bunch of points and we ordered the speaker Very glad we ordered it Sounds great The only downside is the charging cable is too short I just used a different cord Pairing this speaker with my phone was easy couple glitches but had it done in 10 min Very loud can hear it everywhere in my 1100sq ft home Mainly I bought it for out on my boat I can hear the radio even when my 90 4 stroke is full throttle No buttons sticking out to break this seems durable expect this will be in service for a long time Battery life seem okay Gotten it wet with no issue Not going to water test it will save that for somebody else Yes I would recommend it I trust Bose Have radios of 30 years old still work and sound perfectly You always pay more but the quality and workmanship you can t deny they are just amazing and last forever to me that is worth a lot We own 2 clock radios headphones and now this wireless speaker This speaker was easy to connect to phone etc and works great Sound quality is amazing Charges up quickly and each time you use it will tell you how much charge you have left We use it often as we sit by our fire pit at night Very happy with item This thing is awesome I got it in the green and it has woodsy vibes The sound is amazing I use it 2x a day in the shower as well as on my back sun porch It packs the perfect amount of bass and the sound quality is superb with everything from pop r and b country classical opera you name it The battery life is good and the connectivity is instant Very happy with it I ve been purchasing Bose products for about 25yrs Their products are usually well made durable sturdy efficient and unbreakable based on how you care for your products I purchased this little gem and didn t open it until a week later Used it for 2 hours put it back in the storage case that I purchased because we must care for our Bose products properly LOL Went to use it today 3 days later and the battery is at 30 The battery life on this speaker SUCKS Bose needs to upgrade or do something about this speakers battery life Other than that it s a great speaker with great output to my liking What s not to like about this speaker Great sound in a small package The highs and lows air outstanding I own several Bose products and a few from other well known brands So I truly appreciate great sound reproduction For the size this is outstanding I read other reviews that say not enough bass or treble I believe you will enjoy this speaker for what it is A small but great sounding speaker I bought this Bluetooth speaker as a replacement for my another brand of speaker that was showing its age after several years This speaker sounds really really good for its size It puts out quite a bit of bass for a speaker this size I wish the battery lasted longer but of course if it lasted twice as long I would still make the same comment I highly recommend this speaker I bought this for my husband on Amazon Prime Day but I LOVE it so much that he has left it in our kitchen so I can also use it during the day The sound is amazing We were listening to a Dave Matthews concert and truly it was like we were there Highly recommend I wanted a small Bluetooth speaker for my computer for basic sound music YouTube videos etc when I didn t feel like putting on my head phones So picked up this Bose after reading the glowing reviews Being a Bose I expected good sound but this blew past my expectations when it came to bass and clarity Battery life was also good as well as charging time Very pleased Bose is known for its quality speakers and this is no exception I work outside in my garden for hours on end and I need to connect with music podcasts and Audible books This unit exceeded my expectations It is just fantastic and I bought it on sale 33 1 3 off What a steal I ve had other bluetooth speakers that were pretty good but my wife always has positive comments when someone has a Bose speaker playing AND SHE S RIGHT I don t say that very often but this speaker is excellent When I play it then stop and play my other bluetooth speaker there s really no comparison The Bose has significantly better base and extremely clear tones You can just feel it in the weight of the item It s solid There s no going back We love it I have been a Bose fan for quite sometime The sound quality range and performance are great I connect it to my phone where I listen to music live events and podcasts I jumped at the chance when it went on sale during Prime The fact that it has a hook for portability is great I must admit I initially wondered if I would miss stereo sound from my listening experience because this particular unit puts out mono sound You can pair two of them and get stereo separation but in my opinion that would be a bit contrary to one of its main features portability In any case the sound quality that comes out is full and rich including low end I ve been listening to my favorite music through this speaker music I ve heard since the 70s through all manner of listening devices from full featured stereo systems to Walkman headset units and the listening experience through this speaker is beautiful I absolutely adore this speaker The color is perfect the material is soft and easy to clean and I m SO pleasantly surprised at the quality of sound You can place it on its side for directional sound or lay it flat for very clear all around sound It s the perfect size for desktop counter and luggage space The clear and crisp audio and waterproofness make this a great speaker to use in the shower Charging is simple and straight forward USB C like 90 of my other devices Buttons are soft and durable So far I haven t encountered anything I don t like about it I had a 10 year old Bluetooth speaker that was slowly dying so I bought this one on Prime Day Let me tell you it is LOUD has great sound bass it s portable and easy to connect to my iPhone The battery charges fast and it stays charged for days of use I LOVE IT 7 3 24 My Bose Sound link speaker was delivered today Just in time for the 4th of July picnics and outdoor music I owned a Bose Soundlink I for years unfortunately it was locked in a hot car for 3 door before I realized I had left it there and it played a short whiel and died I just got this one and the sound is even better It s a compact size and I chose the dark green color something different from my white one I listen to a lot of Biblical recordings and through the speaker it gives it a fantastic voice and musical entertainment The price seems reasonable compared to other potable speakers and I am putting o n the list for possible Xmas gifts Bought this to replace some lesser quality speakers Like the rich sound but really like that it tells you how much battery is left every time you turn it on Also hooks up to multiple devices iPad and iPhone at the same time I got this for my husband as his tractor s radio quit working He spends long hours working so it helps him to have something to listen to He loves this speaker it sounds great and is very easy to operate Happy Hubby I bought this speaker to use in my home The great thing about it is that it s blue toothed to my phone The sound is very clear in a small places I m glad I made this purchase Great sound for a small unit Like that it is waterproof and very portable We are remodeling our master bath and it will be nice to have quality sound while I soak in the new jetted tub I know the reputation of Bose products but quite frankly wasn t expecting this to be as good as it really is for the low price It is solidly built and the sound and fidelity are truely amazing I m not sure why but the engineers gave this little speaker feet instead of a sturdy base I m a klutz and I expect I ll knock this over or to the ground at any point Does not seem sturdy in that capacity Otherwise it s a thick and dense little speaker Functions as it s supposed to Charged well when I got it I can hear it from the other room when I walk away and it s got a nice clear quality to the speaker so far The charging cord that came with it was quite short but functional The speaker and instructions are insistent about downloading a useless connection application Seems like another way to advertise more speakers or to sell user data It was irritating enough I almost rated this less because of it Speaker will not connect to my phone via Bluetooth unless I allow the speaker access to contact information What a dubious and unwanted feature Also almost rated less than 4 stars for this We will see about the value for the money over time Purchased at the end of May 24 used 5 times at the time of this review The design weight size and sound quality are amazing for the price Bought it near the end of June and now July 31 the same speaker is 40 00 less Too much of a hassle to return Got this speaker on Prime days and have ZERO regrets For a small speaker this Bose speaker EXPLODES with sound The bass is amazing and the outdoor sound projection is wonderful Buy it Bought because I needed music by pool Toggled between JBL and Bose both would have been a good choice This speaker packs great sound especially base Bluetooth connects easy Highly recommend I had an older version of this speaker so it was time for an upgrade It sounds great and for the price I couldn t turn it down This speaker will NOT disappoint you This speaker gets very loud perfect for outside use for picnics and such also works amazingly well for indoor use i just got it the other day and used it while boxing at the gym Heavy base songs also sound really nice on it so far This tiny speaker sounds amazing Very impressed Perfect for playing music and podcasts from my phone while I m working around the house and I can hear better than my phone speaker So far it has worked very well for us the sound is good and the charge lasts a long time the material is nice but not so easy to clean The quality of sound is great It s nice and compact The battery life is ok The charging is odd It doesn t charge well with an extension cord There is a voice that tells the charging level Some times charges to 80 or 100 I mounted to my motorcycle with padded foam just in case So far no major problems Got this for my wife as a Christmas present she s happy with it The sound is really good Her only complaint is she wishes the battery lasted a little longer The sound quality is great and I like that it has a good IP rating Waterproof also means dust proof so we can use this at the motocross track I have the original Bose sound machine for years and the quality is fabulous I wanted some thing that I could take around with me Didn t wanna spend the money Found this one and thought I d treat myself Glad I did can t say that the sound is quite as clear but it s perfect for what I need This speaker is amazing smaller than I thought it would be but PERFECT The sound quality is amazing deep sound Absolutely love it Bose for the win I purchased this during Prime days to replace my last speaker The new speaker looks great and sounds great I am glad I chose this speaker I bought this during Prime Days Love it and got it for a good price I bought the teal colored one and I love it The sound is awesome Just got it needed to download an app to get it to connect dumb Wouldn t connect had to hold down the power button for 10 seconds to reset it then it worked with the app Also deleted all other Bose Bluetooth devices not sure if that was necessary or not It sounds great Commanding sound deep breathing bass smooth clarity and plenty of pitch and tone to drone out any annoying neighbors cars traffic kids wives errrr I mean great product Love this little thing So portable and surprisingly bumpy base and clear sound I m a big Sonos fan and considered both of their portable speaker products but in the ended decided on the Bose SoundLink primarily because of affordability So glad I did Not to mention the color options are so cute something for everyone for sure This little box put s out some great music and you can feel the bass I will only buy Bose from now on WOW what a product Arrived as predicted and was easy to set up Very pleased with the color I chose and the sound was perfect The price was great also I absolutely Love love love this portable speaker The sound bass and range are great both indoors and outdoors When it goes back on sale I am purchasing a second one my mom and two cousins want one now as well The party never stops with this speaker Sleek and modern looking design The sound quality is great and it s small enough to take everywhere We love these small speakers I have had Bose speakers for years but these are my favorite because they are small and my favorite colors Bose is a special product and always has been Well built fit and finish is second to none and most important that fantastic Bose sound We all know Bose sounds great but for the money this speaker rocks Grab two of them and pair them together for bigger sound My Beats Pill died and I replaced it with this Oh my goodness I m amazed at the quality the sound everything I love it I have been wanting a bluetooth speaker to have when my family and I are hanging out in the backyard This Bose speaker sounds great and has really good sound quality in such a compact design It charges quick and you can use it while it is charging It is easy to connect or pair with a Bluetooth device We ve tried a half dozen speakers but Bose is by far the best Easy setup Long battery charge 10 12 hrs Great sound Very good speaker It is not cheap It could be more cheap The brand Bose add some value I would like more power At small room or at a table of friends is ok At noise outdoor like a beach or gin it does need max vol We had2 JBL flip waterproof speakers and one finally gave out They have wonderful sound I decided to get the Bose because I ve always wanted one This sounds tremendous Nice bass Battery lasts a long time Try it for yourself you will definitely like what you hear It s a Bose so I expected high quality audio and the speaker does that It s compact and that s part of the issue It tips over very easily as the base is rather narrow Second the battery life leaves a bit to be desired It s not as long as other speakers I have had but it s decent I wish the bright white blue lights were red or could be turned off It gives off just enough light to be bothersome if you truly need a dark room to sleep Forget using the app all it does is connect and you don t really need it to even do that It wouldn t control anything on this speaker Lastly why is it talking I don t need it to tell me the battery level or that my device is disconnected I don t need it to speak at all It s rather annoying bc if you disconnect and don t turn it off it promptly reminds you Spooked the hell out of me several times It gets 4 stars bc audio wise it s absolutely on point as expected It s the little details that are missing that list a star Would I buy again With improvements yes as is I d have to think about it I like the sound quality and how it projects from the sleek designed speaker Considering the small frame it performs in a great way I was thoroughly impressed by the sound for the size speaker this is It is a convenient size with a big punch I am happy to report that the skeptic in the family was also impressed and I got the thumbs up on the purchase Personal use Hand hang strap used to keep out of sandy areas Sand and waterproof Would recommend fir beach vacations I purchased this because water broke my old Bose Revolve I don t consider myself an audiophile but I do listen to music religiously 100k hours annually and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance This speaker lacks the nuance It s not terribly loud in my opinion even on full volume in my small apartment However it is durable and I love that it s waterproof Upon further research I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand as these speakers can be made for less than 50 and sold for 400 Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex product listed here as well in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment After doing some research I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant I purchased this on Prime Day for 99 before tax I would NOT say it s worth 150 full price The battery is not great I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over Mediocre in performance overall It s worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose RETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers Keep that in mind Sounded great but I could never get it to connect with Alexa I ended up returning it It may have been operator error but in any case i wanted voice control and I s couldn t make it work I really liked the size etc also I bought this for my husband and we love it Great sound quality switches between bluetooth users easily and does what it says Van lifer here Needed something better than my cell and this is wonderful Nice bass I don t have WiFi sound I can t use the app evidently but I ll set up sound preferences when I am connected This is a great speaker Small and compact give out great quality sound I like the ambient sound worth the money folks I LOVE this such fabulous sound pairs with my phone and tablet Wish it paired with my laptop Compact and useful Would have liked to have a wall charger transformer plug included but the USB charge cord works well This was a nice surprise I wanted a portable bluetooth speaker for my home office and opted for this Bose unit because of the positive reviews So far the positive reviews have been spot on Great and very clean sound clarity even when the volume is maxed out Easy to use and I like the option of being able to connect two different devices onto this speaker The party mode feature of being able to connect to another Bose Soundlink speaker is something I might try sooner than later as having an extra speaker in the garage would be nice I am not young and am not great at things in the tech world but this is so easy to use with my smart phone and it sounds great just like my old Bose CD player I use it with Spotify to listen to the songs of my youth and it is just great Loud enough for me and clear crisp sound Definitely follow the Bluetooth link instructions or you ll get frustrated So far no complaints I ve had various Bluetooth speakers that I use for my yoga classes This one beats them all The sound is amazing the charge lasts a long time and it s very light to go into my bag I bought the silicone cover which was a game changer LOVE this product You won t be disappointed I got this mainly for use in the bathroom but find myself carrying it with me room to room Battery life is reasonably good I charge it every day Stays connected when I walk away from it to another room and even outside Sound is great impressive bass for a little speaker I had purchased numerous low end cheap ass Bluetooth speakers in search of something on par with a Bose speaker That does not exist I finally bought the Bose and wish I would have done that from the start This thing is a beast Superb performance great battery life and it seems to very durable It may seem like a big nut to spend on a speaker but at the end of the day it really is a good value for the phenomenal sound If you spend the money for a speaker in this range this is the one It will surprise you Nice and loud good sound quality and decent bottom end for such a small speaker very full sound This is my second purchase I wanted one to keep in my barn I definitely recommend A little disappointed in the bass but overall very good sound for the size Too bad you need to download the Bose app to connect to it The marketing guys need to step back and just make it plug and play Bought this to have music by the pool Bose has a great sound connected to the iPad with no issues The battery died on my rockstar portable speaker for the 2nd time and less than a year after replacing it so I decided to buy the Bose couldn t be happier Great sound connects to multiple devices at the same time and fits in my luggage Great device for the price We took this for our vacations we played music all the way to California 4 hours Next day we went to the beach and it didn t died on us until the night We were very happy with it especially when anyone can share their playlist I don t know how they do it but Bose gets good bass and nicely balanced sound out this speaker To sum it up in 3 letters WOW Totally impressed by the sound this little might produces Great sound super ridiculously easy set up and I recommend it highly PS just got this so hence the 4 stars The sound is amazing and easy to handle The only thing is that don t connect to te Bose App Purchased this to replace my 12 year old Bose speaker OMG worth it Battery last all day sound is amazing Great bass and crisp loud sound I love this speaker It has been to the beach the pool and our backyard Its hardcore No need to baby this speaker at all 100 would purchase again in another 12 years I tested this model against the other two more expensive Bose Bluetooth speakers and for the price this one sounds great Easy to carry and the battery lasts a long time too The JBL Flip 6 Bluetooth speaker is an absolute winner This speaker delivers exceptional sound quality with deep bass and crystal clear highs that make my music sound fantastic whether I m indoors or out The 360 degree sound really fills the space and creates an immersive listening experience One of the best features is its portability The compact size makes it super easy to take anywhere and it fits perfectly in my backpack or on a small shelf Despite its small size it packs a powerful punch and can get surprisingly loud without any distortion The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and has a good range allowing me to play music from my phone without any interruptions The battery life is impressive too lasting for hours on a single charge which is perfect for long outings or parties Another big plus is its durability The Flip 6 is waterproof and rugged so I never worry about taking it to the beach or poolside It s built to withstand splashes and even the occasional drop Overall the JBL Flip 6 is a top notch Bluetooth speaker that combines great sound portability and durability I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and high quality speaker Everything about this speaker is great it connects to bluetooth very easily and has great quality The cord works great and charges the speaker very fast It is a medium size so it fits very well There are lights that show you if it is on and what percent the battery is on along with this it lasts very long These will always be my favorite speakers This is the third I have bought of these After years of one JB Flip it finally gave out on me and I bought another I have dropped one of these in a deep sink at work and after a couple days it was right back to playing as clear as before and was functioning just fine This one was one I bought for my dad for Father s Day He loved the Camo color and of course when he tested it out it gave really strong and clear sound The Bluetooth connected easily and from my experience with these speakers for me it was worth the money I known it will last for years in love color and design absolutely gorgeous sound quality and volume bluetooth connectivity durable amazing value for money super portable size holdable shape my favorite speaker so far I bought this for my bf and he loves it The battery life is great for parties or a day at the beach I can say the sound is clean crisp and loud The only CON is that it doesn t have much range so keep that in mind if you are purchasing We paired it with his phone the first time and he was walking around during the party so the music kept cutting in and out Just have your devise like your laptop paired close Pros Sound quality in a smaller space is outstanding for its sizeFlawless pairing and BT distance is more than you would need in and outdoor spaceVery durable water prof in shallow depthsPortable in nearly every scenario Able to find used on Marketplace as low as 50180 degree sound dispersion with low attenuation outside the forward facing speakersCons Battery life if playing above 65 volume is not greatWon t connect to and JBL with Connect so only Flip 5 and up with Party Boost will pair At lower volume the bass is perfectly balanced and falls short as volume is increased Larger areas can be a bit challenging without 2 of these little sound monsters Charging does take a bit of time from dead to full charge It does not float so if you loose it in the lake or river its probably gone for good Love everything about this The sound is amazing One of the best features is someone else brought a JBL to my pool and turned it on and it picked up what mine was playing so we had it on two speakers it was fantastic I love how lightweight and compact it is It s also really attractive One of the best things about the number six version is that it is waterproof Perfect for poolside just incase of an accident I purchased this for my husband for a special gift and this was perfect and amazing it s not bulky and you charge it up like your phone also don t let size discourage you this JBL is perfect size and volume is fantastic Comes in different colors and it can go anywhere also blue tooth connectivity This you won t regret This speaker has definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of audio quality It does a have a few imperfections but overall I think it deserves 5 stars The mids and highs get drowned out a bit by the bass when indoors However I ve found that when outside the OP bass overcompensates for the fact that bass does not carry as well in open space and this speaker sounds spot on It gets pretty loud but I did expect it to have a bit more but the speaker is much smaller than I expected That might just be me This feels very well constructed and is fairly heavy Highly recommend for audiophiles looking for an outdoor speaker that you want to bring with you anywhere JBL Flip 6 Bluetooth speaker I ve been meaning to do a proper review of this speaker for a while now but finding the time to do so has been difficult As I mentioned before in a previous post JBL s Bluetooth speakers are excellent As someone who prefers a HiFi setup individual components like a receiver CD player turntable bookshelf speakers etc I have never been a fan of Bluetooth speakers I prefer the definition clarify and instrument separation you find in a good pair of passive bookshelf speakers powered by a clean amplifier or receiver and that preference has not changed But being able to easily take your music with you wherever you go does have its benefits I ve been through quite a few Bluetooth speakers over the years mainly Ultimate Ears speakers and I couldn t believe how poor the quality of sound was from those speakers I pretty much gave up on Bluetooth speakers until I decided to try out the JBL Flip 6 For such a small speaker I could not believe how powerful and clean the sound was I ve since tried out the JBL Charge 5 the JBL Xtreme 3 and even the JBL Boombox 3 and each one of those speakers produces great sound The JBL Boombox 3 is monstrous and no one really needs that kind of sound unless you re entertaining guests in a small or medium sized venue At the end of the day I will always prefer to unwind with a CD or vinyl record played through my stereo receiver and bookshelf speakers at home and a Bluetooth speaker will never match the clarity and definition of a great pair of passive bookshelf or tower speakers fed by a high quality amplifier or receiver but JBL s Bluetooth speakers are a good investment if you want to be able to take your music with you Again I recommend the Flip 6 but if you re able to spend a little more money I recommend the Charge 5 or Xtreme 3 I photographed my Flip 6 perched on two books for scale and also for the promotion of literacy You know I can t help myself By the way both of those books in the photo are superb I purchased this speaker to replace my wireless polk audio speaker which stopped working with the app This speaker is awesome and has a nice low end with a nice strong range in volume When fully charged it will play for a very long time on a charge it has never lost power on me even on loud volumes It s very easy to use and connects very easily with blue tooth with no issues For the money you can t beat it I wouldn t hesitate to buy another JBL This is a powerful little speaker didn t realize how powerful until I turned up the volume And about scared myself lol Sounds great super portable nice base just all around good good product I even bought a case for it to match Pairing was a breeze Wi Fi synced right up right out of the box plug and play got to love that Love that I got it on sale from prime Days so glad I did You just can t go wrong with JBL I got the teal in the flip six and the case super happy So let start off by I m old school when it comes to selecting speaker I have a massive surround system that sound great I stumbled across the little speaker by accident So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me Now I starting thinking of 2 1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush The Weapon this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation I also played Led Zeppelin s Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long I d like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM FM with USB and SD card In closing don t overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I m sure you ll love too Update with about a week of playing some music and experimenting The flip 6 turn on its end with tweeters up will produce the best sound and great sound stage It does better in the vertical position cause the woofer and tweeter vertically aligned give better sound stage hence the vertical axis Now pair it with a second and you ll have killer stereo mode And the charge 5 to the center and you will love the sound as it acts like a sub reinforcement I ve had no problems with it I got it to upgrade from the 4 and I was surprised how much stronger the bass is on the 6 The sound it makes when it turns on and off is also a lot quieter as a bonus There is one issue that I ve had where the sound becomes distorted and crackly but I found that having it connect to one Bluetooth device at a time fixes that I already own a Flip 4 and knew these smallish speakers delivered amazing sound The only issue I have is that the Flip 6 and Flip 4 cannot be connected together The Flip 6 uses PartyBoost while the Flip 4 uses Connect This is my fault for not doing the research before purchasing I ll have one speaker for pool side and another for inside Ordered a speaker because we ve been having issues with our UE Boom 2 speaker I think that for the price this is a great speaker Bass sounds nice no vibrating noises I almost like it better than our UE Boom speaker which costs more This Flip 6 is the best one among all other Flip models Perhaps with that new tweeter that they have added it became the best sounding and loudest flip of all Anyway it is an awesome bluetooth speaker not just in JBL line up but among all other reputable name brands speakers I am absolutely happy with the purchase and the quality of the speaker I bought mine for work and it lasts about 6 7 hours on a full charge and with the original charging cord it charges faster Last week it fell in the engine compartment and the fan hit it and still works like a champ Only thing I would say negative is I wish it would stay charged all day but for this price you can t beat it Love the sound quality and volume from this tiny wonder The portability and 12 hr run time put this little Bluetooth speaker at the top of my recommended list Got it on prime days sale for 90 BIG sound for a small bluetooth speaker proves that size don t matter I love this speaker it s waterproof and taking it to the beach is easy peasy couldn t ask for a better speaker AND got it on PRIME DAY even a bigger plus I never write a review but this one needs to be at the top I highly recommend this item if you lice music and all it s glory If you like bass and loud this is your device If you re in doubt for buying it doubt no more just buy it Have a great day I dont know where people get off writing bad reviews criticizing this thing It is compact and is loud as hell for its size I haven t owned it for long so the battery life remains to be seen but I would definitely recommend it As a bonus I was able to get it under 100 for prime day This has a very nice sound for a small portable Bluetooth speaker We use this when we don t want to put on the full backyard speakers or on a bike ride It s also perfect for the side of the hot tub neighbors would agree With the sound of the jets we would have the outdoor speakers louder which could disturb the neighbors We can set this right by the tub for great personalized sound Has held up very well have had for a few months I have to admit that most of my listening is done in the bathroom at low volume with my phone as the source But the sound has no flaws that jump out at me even on occasional times it s louder I was going to buy another brand that was twice the price and my son said to get this one He said at work in the oil field they have one of these that is great So I tried it It s perfect The sound is great it gets loud if you need and It keeps a charge for a very long time and it didn t break the bank Awesome speaker to get on prime day about 30 off VERY competitive with a BOSE speaker I have that was over double the price Bluetooth connectivity was easy and there is an optional companion app that is also very easy to download and navigate should you choose to Would definitely purchase again or purchase additional units Ok so I was debating buying the Flip 6 or the Sony ULT after unboxing and listening to a bunch of different songs and genres I can not be happier with the JBL The volume levels are insane this thing cranks the volume out Second the bass in this thing is nuts sounds incredible and if you mess around wit the app you ll be able to find the perfect balance for your tastes Overall I don t regret this purchase this speaker is amazing and is the perfect size and weight to carry around We bought 2 to sync for use in our backyard patio pool area and so far it has been great So easy to sync to bluetooth and to each other and for the price the sound is great Love this little guy At full volume you can get about 6hours out of it Pretty durable I do forestry work and its been knocked around and keeps on going I love this and wish that I could have had one many years ago I now have music in the shower The sound is great and the bass really comes through clearly no distortion JBL has always served me well from my first stereo system speakers up to now You cannot beat them Excellent sound Good base I listen to a lot of oldie vocals from Frank Sinatra to Lou Rawls and many more current singers I do feel Frank is right in the room singing to me The JBL6 sound is better than the earlier JBL s I congratulate the developers Thank you P S Of course I would like longer battery life Who wouldn t Sometimes I don t realize how long I have had the JBL on and forget to charge Once you have reached the limit everything just stops Period This speaker is perfect for out by the pool on the beach or just for listening in the house Sound quality is very good and plenty loud can you say perfect The only speakers I want are JBL is waterproof and hold long This is in comparison to a 40 oz I returned this product to try the Sony Srs xe200 instead It was supposed be 200 watts but not even close maybe that s how much power it drains but sure doesn t perform like it I should ve kept the j b l The Sony maybe a little clearer on the mid and highs but lacks bass dramatically The sound quality is great super easy to set up and it s very portable I tried it out as soon as I got it and the sound exceeded my expectations within the first 10 sec For a relatively smallish speaker it packs a punch This was the perfect upgrade from my JBL flip 3 Ordered something off brand first immediately returned it JBL has a crisp but deep sound and it works just perfectly Easy to take anywhere We take to the pool and has been splashed with no worries at all It s loud enough too for us all to listen to at our community pool Our son in law was using one of these speakers at his house My husband loves his rock n roll but had not been listening as much since being home and retired So I got this for him for Father s Day He loves it He puts it on in the morning while having coffee and takes it outside when he is by the pool or working in the yard He is very happy with this speaker It came early and was on sale Has an excellent sound Would recommend to anyone Love this product Great sound quality and easy to take on the go with me Love this speaker It is small but pretty impressive The bass is good and the mids are clear Got it on Prime Day so very reasonable too High quality sound Comfortable to use and most important the battery is great I love this product the sound is awesome the only downside is it doesn t have a very good lifespan if it s cranked up for very long But if you do least listen to it At a medium volume It will play for about 12 hours but if you re down at the beach and trying to make yourself heard you got about a 4 Hour life I love everything about this speaker The tone easy to use great for outdoors OR indoors Compact and charge lasts Excellent Bluetooth speaker with clear sound and good bass Best one I ve purchased Quality of singing voices was a surprise If the volume is low so the bass is not over driven the sound is amazing for something so small Good sound minor sound distortion at max volume Louder than flip 6 Great sound Easy to operate and charge Nice compact size Would recommend Love this The sound quality is so good the charge lasts ages and I love the red color It s expensive but you get your money s worth I ordered two of them and they both work great I used in for my grandkids pool party They are expensive Great sound and long lasting battery Portable and can take anywhere This is the perfect size and the perfect color it was easy to set up and easy to connect to bluetooth and the price was great Easy to sync to the bluetooth Easy to operate and charge A lasting charge Great engineering quality and sound I am very pleased with this product Good clear sound with plenty of bass I m very satisfied I have 3 of these speakers in my office one on each of my coworkers my desk and they link together and sound so nice There is a very few moments where one loses sound for a few seconds but it comes right back on Other than that I have no problems with these speakers and LOVE THEM Son loves it Great sound for compact size For the price you can t go wrong I was going to get the bigger one but when I got this I charged it and we listened by the pool all day great sound bass is great small enough to put anywhere looks great no distortion at all very good quality for the money I am in my 7th Heaven Get this DONT forget to download the JBL PORTABLE APP Battery does not last 12 hours 6 at best Other than that I love it The out put of Bluetooth sound is amazing Also last the the 12 hrs with charging it I love this It s just the right size to take anywhere you wanna go in the sound is amazing Stopped charging turning on after 5 months that s the only con everything else is great I didn t like the pairing it would not let me connect with YouTube music We use it for cooking day in the kitchen and take it outside when we are lying in the sun Great quality from JBL as always I love this It s small but the sound is great Works better than some of the larger speakers I have had Very good speaker definitely loud Although I have a bigger one this one serves the purpose on most places I go I gave this for my son for his bday and he loves it Although it s small in size it actually is pretty loud the sound is great I liked that it was easy to set up also super great sound Lighter than the bigger ones so you take away a little bit loudness and base but the sound reproduction is accurate and solid and you can pack in luggage and it won t weigh you down with extra luggage fees I love this speaker It gets very loud it s beautiful in color and I love that I can pair it with my boyfriend s flip to amplify the music It works great and the volume is good It s easy to pair to my cell I bought this before our San Diego trip so we would have something for music while on the beach It worked perfectly It s easy to use and the size is perfect I bought this for my granddaughter and her husband for their sailboat I won t go on any sailboat but I have heard the sound from this speaker and it is remarkable and waterproof It is the perfect gift for their boat Love it Recommend Connects easily has good sound quality small and easy to use Big hit at work They have always been good and are improving all the time It took me a while to find a portable speaker There s so many out there It was hard to decide I am very happy with this one I use it every morning when I work out in my garage Its capabilities are much more than necessary But it s cute It works very well The JBL 6 speakers sounds fresh the battery lasts long and is very easy to pair to your celular device I liked the size of it Can be easily carried around Fits easily on side pockets of the bag I also liked the audio quality I use this every day love the charge and the sound Pleasantly surprised by the sound this speaker can produce across different genres It s only 1 speaker but I am still able to hear different voices across the highs lows and mids It was a choice between this speaker and another speaker that is also very good This one came in pink so I went with this one That and frankly it s for using while I m moving around and outside Perfect speaker for that If I had needed a speaker for using inside I would have gone with the other speaker Very durable has some heft to it Bluetooth connectivity was easy The speaker came charged so I was able to try it immediately I ve paired it with my iPod touch iPad iPhone and my pc No issues at all I haven t tried pairing it with my MacBook but I don t anticipate any problems there either The pink is a dusty pink not a bright in your face pink Very happy with my choice We ordered a second one in the dark green Yea we liked it that much overall I believe it works fine to listen to music in your room It may overheat sometimes after a while The charge seems to last pretty long In one of the pictures for some reason The speaker seemed to or open idk I don t know what that is about but nothing crazy Speaker works and sounds great for its size Battery lasts all day or night Love the portability Quality product It s perfect Perfect for what I wanted Over its good quality sound for the price point Geta the job done great for outdoors camping small get together Got a new one for outside building decks kayaking parties etc Last one lasted almost 10 years Lol Won t buy any other brand well worth the money 4 hours on full charge all the way loud I love this speaker it has enough volume and high quality sound I use it when I do water aerobics in my pool Perfect Just wow Paired with my phone seamlessly and was playing music within seconds This thing sounds amazing Impressive full sound from such a small speaker Even my wife that was walking by noticed how good it sounded compared to our Oonze Angle I m very much a bang for the buck kind of guy and this thing are well worth it JBL consistently makes banger products very happy with this I am an owner of two Sonos home speakers the One and the One SL These are amazing sounding speakers that are easy to use While I love these speakers they are not portable as they must stay plugged into an outlet in order to work I looked at the Sonos Move but was turned off by the size of the speaker and the high price Needless to say when Sonos introduced the Roam I was intrigued I got it as a father s day gift and what follows are my thoughts on the new Sonos Roam SoundMy main concern with the Roam was that I noticed it was rather small and how that would effect the sound quality and loudness of the speaker I was foolish for thinking this however Sonos is known for having excellent sounding speakers and they would not jeopardize that reputation by putting out a new product that didn t adhere to their high audio standards This speaker sounds amazing Music sounds rich and full of depth The clarity of the highs is excellent and the bass is surprisingly rich and full Further to the point the Sonos app allows you to tailor the sound to your liking adding more of less treble and or bass I cannot overstate how pleased I am with the audio quality of this diminutive speaker As a secondary point under sound I was also concerned about how loud the speaker could get Indoors this little gem can get plenty loud and fill a large space with amazing sound Outdoors the Roam does a better than adequate job of projecting great music I have taken it in my backyard while doing some yard work and it gets loud enough to hear and enjoy the music However I don t think Sonos designed this speaker to pump out the tunes at the pool party or at the beach like the EU Boom 3 or other larger bluetooth speakers It can function adequately in that role but excels in smaller spaces and in overall sound quality FunctionalityThe speaker works seamlessly with my other two Sonos speakers via WiFi using the Sonos app The ability to move the speaker all over the house is a major plus I can configure the Roam to play alone or with either one or both of my other speakers I love that versatility The buttons have some straight forward uses and also are multi functional which can take some getting used to For example I have issues sometimes with the power button and how long to push it Five seconds to turn it off a quick push to put it in sleep mode to save power Same with the play pause button once to pause music twice to advance to the next song three times to go back to previous song press and hold for a second to put the speaker in bluetooth pairing mode and press and hold and listen for a sound in order to be able to swap your music from the Roam to the closest Sonos speaker or vice versa It has taken some getting used to initially but I m getting the hang of it The battery life is good but I wish it were better I get about 8 hours of play time per charge Charging is another small issue Sonos includes a USB C plugs into speaker to USB A plugs into charger charging cable with the speaker but they do not include a charging adapter to plug into the wall Luckily I have an Apple iPad USB C to USB C cable with a large 20w charging adapter that charges the Roam very quickly I highly recommend the larger charging adapter to greatly reduce charging time As a side note the speaker can function fully while being charged Airplay and bluetooth connectivity are straightforward and work well I have not had any issues connecting the speaker via bluetooth to my phone laptop and various other devices around my home FormThe speaker works in either a horizontal or vertical position with some claiming there is a difference in the sound That is a matter of preference as I like both positions for different reasons Horizontally the speaker is designed to project the sound up and it seems to use the surface the speaker is sitting on to amplify the sound Vertically it sounds great and it is much easier to access the control buttons on top Ultimately I love the design of the Roam because it is small clean and elegant looking In my opinion the Sonos Roam is an excellent speaker because of its portability convenience of use within my existing Sonos system and its superb audio performance I really like this speaker it is unique in the market because it is small portable wireless can connect to your wifi and Bluetooth capable I love to use it at home as desktop airplay speaker One thing I experienced one time is when the speaker reached 40 battery the airplay connection started to failed sound was cutting really bad and I was not able to play continuously not even I turned off on Once I connected to the power the problem was fixed so I am not sure if that was a glitch or something real A second thing I don t like is that currently you have to open the SONOS app to check the battery level while airplaying it I wish you can do the same from the airplay menu maybe that is an apple problem Difficult to write about sound quality I can only tell how it sounds compare to a apple homepod mini similar sound quality less loud Bose Micro soundlink Sonos has much better sound quality and louder Bose Mini soundlink Sonos has better sound quality less bass less loud JBL clip 4 sonos has ultra much better quality Overall I think this is the best small micro sound system in the market don t buy JBL clip 4 or Bose micro soundlink those are trash compare to this one honestly this speaker is pretty loud sounds fairly good a has a decent battery life too the only problem is connecting to it is annoying they made it so the power button and the bluetooth connectivity button are the same button a small press turns the speaker off a long press has it go into connectivity mode buttt too long of a press hard shuts off the speaker this problem is double downed by the fact that the button isnt tactical click its smooth and shallow so sometimes not always its hard to tell if you re actually pressing it downthe speaker will automatically search for the last connected device as soon as it turns on so you dont always have to play the button dance but from time to time for no reason at all my phone computer just refuse to reconnect and you have to unpair and repair playing the button dance once more they also decided to place this easy to press soft shallow button right next to the power connection so expect to bump it plugging the speaker inif they had just made them two separate buttons i would hands down say this is an amazing little speaker but having to spend 5 minutes a few times a day trying to connect to the darn thing is one of the most frustrating daily tasks i have and i wouldnt recommend getting this speaker I needed a speaker for my home gym This speaker was on the pricey side but the sound quality was worth the money Work great for small portable high quality speakers especially for around my pool What s to love sound quality is much better then I expected when I saw how small the speaker is Music is rich and full sounding it connects with Sonos so it plays what is on the other speakers in the house so small that it s super portableLess then ideal qualities Worlds most uncomfortable on off button If you have any kind of arthritis stop reading now and pick a different speaker Especially if you need to reset the speaker you have to hold this button for an interminable amount of time the speaker comes with a charging cable but not a charging cube And that would be a non issue if the speaker didn t require a minimum of 10watt power supply from the port it s plugged into Once I read what was required and bought a more powerful charging cube my issues with the speaker were resolved and I didn t need to return it Thrilled again already have 9 Sonos speakers around my home but wanted another for an outside party Best Buy could not deliver in time so I get one from Amazon The price was the same and worth every penny I was concerned because Best Buy set up my system but with the app my new Roam was found and added to my system very easily We ABSOLUETLY LOVE everything about these speakers but the ROAM has a special place because it is small and mobile goes anywhere Seriously it s small but blasts music like it s 10 times its size Battery life is a solid 10 hours and the USB C and wireless charging options are super convenient Plus it switches between Bluetooth and Wi Fi through the Sonos App seamlessly It survived a day at the beach with its waterproof IP67 rating Now it s not all roses sometimes the bass and midtones get too hyped and drown out the vocals a bit It s a bit pricey but if you can overlook the occasional sound imbalance this speaker s worth every penny Recommended but keep that one quirk in mind I have to say I like a lot of what Sonos has created Although I seen the new Sonos headphones and makes me wonder is Sonos stepping up or stepping down Hope to see some more Unique and Quality products from you all with more options and custom features Also imo keep your poducts at a range than makes them out of everyones league Want a Record Player Go to GoodWill for the Cheep Thrill Want a Fully Functional Powerhouse of a System then Team Sonos might be that Brand The Roam is a small speaker for which you re going to have to expect lower audio quality This thing definitely does not have the somewhat richer sound of a One Being able to pop the plug and take it with me is great and the battery life is excellent but the Roam has some pretty significant flaws that would make me not recommend it It has very fine grained volume controls yet everything below about 25 is almost completely inaudible With other Sonos products you can comfortably set the volume to 10 and have an enjoyable listening experience With the Roam you re going to literally wonder if it s on at all until you turn it up to about 28 It doesn t matter what source you use a test signal at full signal won t even be audible in the lower 20 of the volume band This leads to the second problem if you set the volume to a point where you can actually hear music the Alexa voice is EAR SHATTERINGLY LOUD If you set the volume to the point where Alexa isn t trying to make you have a heart attack your music is inaudible The software s a bit buggy as well It can t be paired with any of your other speakers but it can be grouped with them If you group the Roam with another speaker that s playing you have about a 50 50 shot of it just not doing anything at all It ll be connected the controls will respond it ll be visible in the app as grouped you just won t get any audio After a little fooling around with it you can sometimes work around the problem by starting the playback on the Roam and grouping something else to it Adding the Roam to a group doesn t work reliably at all Some other software bugs make this thing a bit less fun While it remembers if it was last used in Bluetooth or in Sonos mode and will return to the selected mode when turned on again it s not very reliable to switch between modes This isn t something you normally have to do often unless you take your Roam out of the house a lot just leaving it in the Sonos network is viable wherever your WiFi reaches Take it on a trip though and you re going to spend the first 4 or 5 minutes trying to get it to actually switch into Bluetooth mode Re pairing the Bluetooth is similarly annoying It doesn t pair with more than a single device so it s extra steps for switching who s DJing This isn t a problem while the Roam is at home and participating in your Sonos setup of course My real complaint though and something that was exceedingly poorly documented when the product was released is that it DOES NOT PAIR WITH ANYTHING except another Roam Battery life as I said is great This comes at something of a cost though this sucker is way heavier than it looks Personally I d have preferred half the excellent battery life if it meant more room in there for better actual speakers The audio is really barely passable at best and outright embarrassing for something Sonos branded It is not tunable with TruePlay It claims to have some kind of automatic TruePlay learning mode but I have not in any way noticed an improvement in the disappointing sound quality with it running The Roam is definitely better than a no name Bluetooth speaker you d buy at Target That faint praise is the strongest endorsement I can give it If you want to pay nearly two Franklins for something that sounds pretty close to a 16 thing you bought when you went to pick up motor oil the Roam is it Difficult to set up but did so I bought several bluetooth speakers for a side by side comparison I was disappointed in this speaker for a variety of reasons Must download the app in order to use it app requires you to create a sonos account weight and feel of the speaker is cheap it feels like something you would find in a flea market with a knock off brand name like S0NES or something Sound quality is middle of the line it sound better with some types of music but struggles with otherssome good things about the speaker if you are in the sonos ecosystem this speaker would be a great addition to your system it has built in wifi which has several advantages once you have the app downloaded connection is super easy and very stable it s not very heavyIn the end I think this speaker is far more expensive than it should be for it s overall middle of the road performance cheap build quality and poor ergonomics There are much better speakers to be found if you don t need the wifi functionality I returned this in favor of the Bose smart speaker which has much better sound But this is probably as good as you ll get for a fully waterproof speaker I m very annoyed that they charged a return shipping AND restocking free Be careful who you re actually buying from I ve owned Sonos products since day one and have a house full of early models and new Got the Roam even after reading about the difficulty setting it up It took days to sort out the issue which required my own workaround Sonos has been trying to force the software update to the S2 app which will not work with my older equipment When trying to set up the Roam I installed the S2 app connected to a separate Wi Fi network but as many users report I could not set up a new account as any email address I entered was reported as already in use which was impossible Once I called Sonos that issue disappeared which is suspicious I wonder if they have something internal to prevent this Sonos support told me to unplug all my devices then set up the Roam on a split system which I refused to do as I did not want to risk my old equipment not working Once you set up S2 you cannot revert back so do not do this I ignored their advice and was somehow able to create the new Sonos account and activate my Roam All that should be unnecessary for users like me that only want it for Bluetooth play To Sonos if you want to be in the Bluetooth market change your software to enable Bluetooth only and stop trying to force loyal customers to the S2 I ll eventually replace the old equipment but on my terms The Sonos Roam Bluetooth Speaker is very reliable in the sense that the battery last a whole day We used it during one of our beach outings and we let it play the whole time and practically ignored it We later realized that it has been playing in the background the whole time My friends love it that they ordered the same product recently Highly recommended Every day if I want to use them I have to turn them off wait then turn them on and then re connect through spotify Doesn t even matter if it s spotify or the SONOS app same thing these speakers just forget the network every day multiple times per day It s like SONOS assumed the only time people would use these speakers is by power cycling them every use Horrible experience makes me want to sell off my entire SONOS collection play bar bridge sub 2x play1 amp sub mini era 100 2x roam with another brand Size of the speaker is outstanding when you play the sound loud sounds pretty good The equalizer adjustments are just lacking only treble and bass is adjustable Purposely bought the Roam with the available speaker so I could use TruePlay supposedly feature to adjust sound similar function as a mid adjustment The Roam has plenty available bass good treble but ZERO mid which is the main hit on this device Add mid adjustment and a 5 star review This has a great sound quality and so far the battery keeps a very long charge So easy to move around When I can get the sonos roam to connect to the sonos system its nice but every time I try to use the roam I have to add to the system and there s usually some sort of update required I tried to like the speaker but it just takes some much work to use I ve stopped trying I wish I could return it Definitely worth the upgrade from the other Sonos Roam The microphone on this device allows it to test the room for how its audio is sounding and it automatically adjusts to reduce echo and improve the sound The results mean that even in small areas or large cavernous rooms the speaker is able to create clear crisp sound A must have for anybody who likes their music on the fly I bought this because our old bluetooth speaker battery started to die We wanted something with bluetooth that sounded decent After a reading a few reviews I settled on a Sonos Roam So once we had it in our hands the setup was a total pain It s a bluetooth device right so it ought to just be able to pair with our iphones sadly no 1 Download the Sonos app2 Create an account why do I have to have an account it s a bluetooth device 3 Pair the device to the app wait it can t find the chip that tells it the PIN so you have to read it off the device but it s written in 2pt type screams so go find a magnifying glass4 Pair your app to your wifi network what if you don t have a wifi network 5 Ooops now you have to update the Fing software6 O no it cannot connect to the software server head blows up 7 Try again You have to login again Wife says F this and let me use the old device8 Try again it finally connects and downloads the new software 9 Pair the device AGAIN and repeat the PIN nightmare10 Finally get music to play but only with Airplay through the wifi network there isn t an obvious way to get the bluetooth part to actually workWhy do you have to create a Sonos account Why can t it ship with the latest software yeah I know but it should still work without the need to update it that s just BS Why can t the bluetooth work out of the box and connect like a normal bluetooth device It s just a lame approach to require your customers to HAVE to use an app Never again will I purchase a Sonos device of any kind It s lame I received the Sonos Roam this week and proceeded to set it up First nothing about this set up is intuitive The instructions are a joke because they are almost non existent I spent two hours figuring out the steps through a myriad of YouTube videos the Sonos website and following the instructions on the app First you need to download the app set up an account and connect to your Wifi and Bluetooth if you want Bluetooth information which is non existent in the sparse instructions Another feature that could use improvement are the buttons The top with the volume and mike controls are hard to see and the button on the back is a bit funky I didn t rate this product on the battery life since I ve only had it for a short time The saving grace for this product is the sound quality which seems fairly good Sonos could improve this product in a number of ways so if you purchase it the speaker seems good enough for the price but unless you are a total techie be prepared to fiddle around with the set up it s no cake walk Clear sound and great product This little portable speaker is impossibly always in sleep mode It will not WAKE UP to connect It s difficulty defeats it s entire purpose I m bummed I wanted a portable Sonos to complement my Sonos sound bar I have initiated a return but don t know what I ll replace it with I wish the technology and connectivity didn t SUCK First of all I would like to say that I have never reviewed any product before But I am so unhappy with this product that I just had to give it a poor review I purchased two Sonos roam speakers for my small business One for the front and one for the back of the store And I have had nothing but problems I chose the Sonos roam speakers because I liked the idea of being able to hook up multiple speakers wirelessly Which seemed like it would be perfect for my store But I tried everything to get this product to work correctly I went through every troubleshooting procedure possible on so many different occasions with the Sonos company that I have lost count I can get one speaker to work correctly but I cannot get both speakers to work at the same time with any consistency While one speaker is working and playing music perfectly fine the other one will play music for a couple of minutes and then it will cut out for anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes and then just come back on for no apparent reason Sometimes it s the front speaker Sometimes it s the back speaker And every now and then they will both work properly for a period of time and then all of a sudden I m back on the phone with Sonos trying to figure out the problem And still it does not work So unless you want a lot of frustration and unless you want to be on the phone with Sonos on a regular basis I would suggest trying a different product I would like to say that in a world of haters I am not a hater I give good reviews when deserved I have Sonos speakers throughout my house and love them these simply did not meet the same standards when I took them out of the box they were much smaller than I expected but felt heavy and solid after charging them I added them to my Sonos app and selected a song with lots of instruments to see how they would perform vocals kinda tinny and Base seemed forced did not match the music next I paired them with the two Sonos one s in my kitchen in a matter of seconds all speakers off line not connected to wifi speakers dropping in an out and cracking I could never get them to play with other Sonos speakers which was primarily why I bought them lastly I played a song on my Sonos roams in stereo and then played the same song at the same volume on my two Bose revolves paired in stereo it was like night and day the bose speakers blew them away deep rich seamless bass great mids and vocals and the speakers filled the room I was really hoping for them to be great and they were just ok I returned them keeping my Bose revolves I live in apartment with shared wifi Someone already had a sonos account with the wifi so I had to find a whole new network to set it up Once setup you can connect with bluetooth but it doesn t connect out of the box We bought two speakers Use both together one sounds like it s blown already We don t crank up like we did back in the day but apparently Have spent thousands on my six room SONOS system only to find last week that latest controller software update no longer supports my speakers Don t buy SONOS without a written lifetime guarantee of support I couldn t care less about their AI ambitions I just want to listen to MY music on MY speakers They are speakers for God sakes not computers Every effort to contact SONOS support was unsuccessful No phone number functioning and when I tried ChatSupport all I got was a spectacularly rude stupid condescending ChatBot that criticized me for having a two year old speaker system This is a company who is so full of themselves that they ve forgotten why they succeeded in the first place which was a high quality speaker purchased and supported by loyal audiophiles like me They have abandoned their customer base and will have a very hard time regaining our trust After all it costs almost nothing to maintain the original S1 and S2 controllers So if you re good spending 1500 for a couple of WiFi bluetooth speakers that you know are going to suddenly stop working in 2 years when they release another death bot software upgrade then go for it Otherwise look elsewhere The sound on these is unmatched and so perfect and portable Sonos does not stand behind offer of 3 month Apple music if extend warranty is purchased After purchasing Apple says 2 months free Sonos just replies Take it up with Apple Apple says its Sonos s offer The roam is a decent speaker Note you must Forget Bluetooth to use as Wi Fi connection requiring new setup when Bluetooth is required I really like the sonos ecosystem they are not the loudest but the fidelity and specially the software and the integration with amazon and Spotify are the best feature well apple music too Ordered this for patio when grilling and just hanging out Loud enough and great with the clip I got for it that I screwed onto my deck so no worrying about it falling I m graciously giving this 2 stars because it really does sound fantastic this is one of the most blatant false advertisements I ve come across in a long time It says Roam right in name why would I think IT CAN NOT ROAM let me repeat it CAN NOT ROAM The Sonos app for this speaker is so unnecessary Sure it makes sense for a home system where you connect it But this is Roam right Well the speaker WILL NOT WILL NOT work if your phone isn t on Wi Fi that s right you can have full 5G bars hot spot etc and everything else you could possibly imagine but if you can not connect to Wi Fi it won t work not only that but in order to connect to the speaker to your music the Sonos app must be set up and open at the same time as use of the speaker your Sonos app must ALWAYS be on the same Wi Fi as the phone So vacation pool hotel etc and your phone is on their Wi Fi but you haven t set the app up with the guest Wi Fi and this means you must have passwords and the passwords MUST be entered in the app along with the Bluetooth connection not just connecting through a guest Wi Fi meaning you MUST also set up the guest Wi Fi in the app not just connect by Bluetooth Without all these things THE SPEAKER WILL NOT WORK it doesn t roam it s just sad was perfectthanksNicholas in Connecticut after a couple try s on othe blue tooth speakers this one sounds great for the size it can really belt out some music and not get muddy base as others have The wifi connnection works great but didn t like that i was limited to each streaming service thru the sonos platform It was easy to just turn off wifi and just pair it to Bluetooth to run music selections the way i am familiar with Even the unboxing of speaker you tell that there was a lot of thought how a customer will enjoy get this speaker The Roam was very easy to set up and only took about 2 minutes to add to my Sonos system I love the Airplay feature so I can play my Apple Music songs without worrying about being too far for Bluetooth to reach If you re looking for a portable system and already have a Sonos speaker or two this is a great option Love the quality sound and yet small portable size Perfect Works great Good buy Connects perfect to my other sonos Love this addition to my other Sonos speakers Currently listen to the Roam in man cave Typically Sonos does a great job but right now I m sitting with two 1 1 2 pound paperweights Tried to connect to a new Wi Fi network but too many protocols meaning that I need to always put in my room number and a code number which Sonos doesn t understand So I did what any what any idiot would do I factory reset the speakers Once I did that the party was over YOU MUST CONNECT TO A WI FI NETWORK B E F O R E YOU CAN CONNECT TO A BLUETOOTH SIGNAL NOW I M STUCK AS I SAID WITH PAPERWEIGHTS BE WARNED AND SONOS SUPPORT IS NOT VERY GOOD THEY SAID THERE WAS A WAY TO USE A HOTSPOT BUT THEY WOULDN T TELL ME HOW BECAUSE IT WASN T OFFICIAL OH WELL Positive Great sound definition in all frequencies from strong bass to sharp trebles Negative everything else It ended up being an expensive Bluetooth speaker Alexa works in a very limited number of countries so it didn t work for me Built in Sonos voice command works for a while then needs a reset which isn t the most straightforward process Connection through wifi often doesn t work requiring frequent resets Usually I ll give up on it and connect via Bluetooth Battery life isn t great either Having it plugged in all the time makes life easier Commands either through buttons on the speaker or the Sonos app aren t very intuitive I love Sonos We have 4 of the play1 speakers in our home I have a 20 portable speaker which has fabulous battery life like lasts about a month per full charge and saw that Sonos came out with their own portable so we decided to get it so it can connect with the indoor speakers as well Unfortunately if it doesn t stay plugged in almost 100 of the time the battery runs dead very quickly If I take it off the charger on a Monday evening don t use it at all and then go to play music on it the next morning it is dead no music no speaker detectable on the Sonos app So that is disappointing If I play it immediately after unplugging the battery will last long enough to enjoy the music but then I have to plug it in soon after Sonos speakers are the best but I wish I had stuck to the small play 1 s that are just always plugged in way easier for reliable and consistent ways to listen to music compared to the constant concern with battery life This worked fine for the most part The battery would sometimes die even when it wasn t turned on if you didn t leave it on the charger But other than that it was fine until we went on vacation for a couple weeks When we got back it was bricked I had left it on the wireless charging pad I couldn t get it to turn on no matter what I tired I then plugged it in with a USB C cable thinking that it might just need to recharge That did nothing Factory reset doesn t work It just has an orange light when plugged in Looks like a common problem Trash product with a defective design I was looking for portable speaker that was compatible with my other Sonas speakers so I could be listening to the same music outside as I had playing in my apartment I m spend a lot of time on my balcony Works great and has excellent sound for a little feller In my experience this speaker will not hold a full charge past more than a day or 2 They say 10 days in standby that s BS It s like it s still on to some degree even after you press the button to turn it off Most of the time when I went to use it it was completely dead One time I charged it back up and it wouldn t connect to my WiFi or let me pair it via Bluetooth to my iPhone I had to factory reset it and set it up again I ended up returning it Sonos quality has gone down in recent years IMO I don t really recommend them anymore Multi room audio and portable audio from lots of other manufacturers has gotten just as good or better than Sonos these days UPDATE just want to say that this device is by far the worst portable speaker I have ever seen Unknown to me my girlfriend bought this because we were going on vacation Getting aside from that fact that this device MUST be setup on wi fi before it can be used it thinks that a Hampton Inn in Miami is the home wifi we had to reset this device no less than 6 times Just like with mine half the time it had no battery but even better when we would try to charge it all we would get is a solid orange light It would never charge and would not turn on If we unplugged replugged the power tons of times eventually it would start charging but frequently would not connect to the wifi and would not show up in anyone s bluetooth Can t tell you how frustrating this was resetting the device resetting the app trying both of our phones Maddening She ended up returning it and getting a normal UE Megaboom bluetooth speaker that thing is a joy to use and is actually reliable unlike the Sonos junk Oh and it has like days of playback time versus the Sonos s pitiful few hours TERRIBLE DEVICE The sound is astonishing the size is small but the power is tremendous very nice to travel or just to put in your room to listen big sounds The sound is good The buttons on it are ridiculous because they are so hard to see There is no battery level unless you sign into the app Connecting from a Sonos app to a Pandora app is a pain if you can figure it out Trying to connect to another Sonos speaker for stereo is again a mystery adventure Not user friendly and definitely would not buy again Avoid the frustration of building a Sonos system I If you don t get this idk what to tell you This was top tier I have three speakers all synced from Sonos app It s for my small business 1400 sqft and it is booming Worth the price instead of doing a whole sound system GET IT trust me I love the sound quality the fact it just uses an app to control so no need to go to each speaker to turn it off or on Also the app shows you battery life You re also apple to use Amazon alexa apple airplay and more You can even control the different sounds making one speaker louder then the other 56yrs old Worken in offices and know a little about tech This is a very difficult unit to use I can t ever seem to get Hey Sonos to listen to me Wanted hands free but seems like I have to turn on the unit each time I want to use it Not like the old school AlexaNot impressed for the spent I purchased a NEW Sonos Roam and received a previous opened one See attached photo I was hopeful it would be in working condition BUT no The speaker was definitely defective with no sound at all coming from the speaker they sent me a new speaker that was not working What a waste of my time and now I have to send it back I am not purchasing another one from Amazon I bought one from Best Buy in person I would ve given zero stars but that wasn t an option We purchased a used very good Roam speaker since it was a bit less expensive than a new one Mistake These are known for bricking after the warranty expires Apparently that s what happened to the one we received We charged it and tried to go through the steps to factory reset the speaker but to no avail The orange light would stay on for about a minute and then go out The usual steps for resetting the speaker didn t work We did everything Sonos told us to do and eventually were told it s dead or bricked I wouldn t recommend getting the Roam speaker Sonos knows this is a problem but never did anything to fix it There are more reliable Bluetooth speakers out there I highly recommend you find one of those This listing is INCORRECT and WRONG It s currently listed as Sonos Roam and NOT listed as what it is a Sonos Roam SL The listing pictures even depict the regular Sonos Roam with a microphone while the SL does NOT have a microphone I ordered a replacement still got a Sonos Roam SL We have a Sonos system in our house with a bar 2 small speakers that plug in and the Move a portable speaker The Roam complements our sound system tremendously Easy to hook up Bluetooth and great sound out of a smaller portable We will take this with us on trips Smaller and convenient The Sonos brand is affordable and gives Bose a run for the money in the opinion of my husband and I We highly recommend Pairs great with the bean and the mini sub Works as advertised Linked easily with existing Sonos system Sound is exceptional Sonos Roam repeatedly will not connect to Sonos Spotify apps The speakers still don t work even after multiple resets of the speakers WiFi connection and factory resets This has happened multiple times where the speakers work for a few weeks and then won t connect AGAIN These Sonos really SUCK Spent 3 hours trying to get this unit to connect to my Sonos s2 network with no luck Super buggy software Sonos latest software revision unavoidable to customers is an utter disaster broken in too many ways to list Inexcusable failure to test Do not buy anything from Sonos until they fix this Great sound from a little box They are smaller than the full size UE Boom so the base isn t as good but still good sound for the size I bought one of these a treat to myself wanting something better than the 40 60 blue tooth speakers out there The sound is fine and there s nothing awful about this devices battery life The Sonos app lets me connect to my accounts on various services and it works well However I am disappointed It seems like twice a week my phone the Sonos app on my phone can t find the speaker and I have to go through this tedious and failure prone pairing process over and over again I just went through 15 minutes of failure with my phone and the speaker 6 inches apart They cannot see each other I m running Android 12 It s ridiculous what I routinely go through simply to use this speaker Buying this speaker was a mistake I wish I d gotten another Creative Airwave for 40 instead of this POS For the size this thing can bring some decent thunder and audio Because this is a smart Sonos speaker it can also hook into your home theatre to add to the versatility This has quickly become my new favorite Sonos speaker in the house Does it sound as amazing as the others No but it certainly comes very close and sounds much better than my other portable speakers The Bluetooth and AirPlay features are super convenient I was able to stream the sound for a video playing on my phone while doing some construction work in a bathroom It even allowed me to group other speakers with it so I could stream my video s sound to other Sonos speakers that were not AirPlay compatible Battery life seems to work quite well although I tend to keep it on a Qi charger to ensure it s always ready to go The Sonos Roam wireless portable speaker has a short list of impressive features That rightfully warrants all of the impressive ratings and reviews For example you can play music through the speaker via AirPlay WiFi Bluetooth And last but not least it water and dust proof that it s rated to But I wouldn t take it swimming with you A great product if a little overpriced connects easily and sounds Absolut Lely wonderful battery outlasts any party and this little device sounds like an larger speaker a great buy CHRISTMAS GIFT LOVING THEM I love Sonos but hate this thing It can only connect when it s plugged in which totally defeats the purpose Update 05 20 2024 I replaced my old Logitech system with 8 Sonos products a very expensive endeavor For a while I was quite happy as I could listen to both streaming services and my large library of music that is not available on streaming services If I wanted to add a song to my current queue it was a simple 2 click operation However for some reason they decided to roll out an app update that eliminated all options to modify the current queue In addition they app has no ability to modify system settings so when I changed my wifi password which I do on a monthly basis I lost the connection to all of my devices So now I have 8 Sonos products that I cannot listen to and I m now faced with once again having to replace my system My advice avoid Sonos I ll update this with alternative systems once I decide which new one I m going with Sounds is great and easy to operate Been searching for a truly portable waterproof chargeable bathroom speaker with great sound Apparently Sonos was listening All of the above connects with my Apple TV and iPhone through AirPlay Has Bluetooth capability to boot Battery life has not been an issue Have charge once in three weeks Supposedly can get wet like in the shower wet Setup was a breeze and played tunes 5 minutes out of the box The size is amazing Almost like a tallboy beer can Couldn t be happier I had a little bit of confusion setting up the Roam The directions are good but the logic threw me The next day I came back and everything clicked I am surprised sound quality is so high in a moderate sized room and the ability to adjust bass and treble is a plus I have never before been able to carry a high performance speaker in my pocket All of this for an amazing price Bravo Sonos I like the alarm features Now I wake to beautiful music from a high quality speaker I do end up keeping it plugged in tho It looses its charge fast The Roam probably makes the most sense as stationary speaker I found that when traveling with it it required a complicated reset any time I wanted to move to another wifi network or connect over bluetooth Still I was fine to use them as smaller cheaper SONOS speakers until 13 months after purchase one of mine just bricked SONOS support is miserable it took hours of interrogation have you held the button for 12 seconds tell us the make and model of USB C charger you re using only for them to tell me that it s out of warranty SONOS s approach here is to require you to pack and return their defective product in order to get a slight discount on something new Pretty shameful and hut my trust in a brand I used to respect Should come with complete instructions I should not have to go on to the internet to discover how to use the speaker I love this speaker It has a great sound and it easy to use Also I ve dropped it a few times and it shows no signs The battery life is okay i guess Sound quality is okay but the thing that drives me nuts is the power button it s has no noticeable feedback no click it should have a click or something i find myself turning it on and off multiple times until i can determine it s on or off very disappointed in the build quality Super loud for its sice It worked fine for about two months Then with about 30 battery left it just died No led lights and would not take a charge after an over night charge to the same brick I have been using An apple brick Called support Some very hard to understand representative said another will be sent to me We will see Very frustrating Probably would never buy again I cannot recommend UPDATEThey sent me a Fedex label to return the dead Roam I did and tracking shows they received it 6 days ago I called them to ask when they would be sending the replacement They have misplaced it They don t know where it is After several frustrating chats and phone calls to who knows where in the world i still don t have any answers other than to just wait until they can find the return and put it into the system Amazon customer service is no help either I am beyond frustrated I got this speaker specifically for use with my computer macbook However this speaker is functionally useless without setting it up via the downloaded app to a cell phone This app REQUIRES you to 1 Create an account and submit an email address to Sonos Full stop There is no way to make this speaker connect to anything bluetooth or otherwise without first giving your email address to Sonos 2 Give the app access to your location in order to set up the account Again this is an absolute requirement that the app will not allow you to work around without revealing your location to Sonos 3 Give the speaker full access to your home internet thereby permanently connecting the device to the web I have a fundamental problem with a company that creates a product that requires you to give them access to your contact information your location and your internet in order to use said product After reviewing all the details of the manual on their company website the customer service confirmed that this is a requirement and there is not other option The only reason I didn t give this 5 stars is the battery life I wish it lasted longer on a charge Love it It would been helpful to know before I bought them I spent hours getting them set up and every time I went to use them one or other or both speakers were not connected and I had to go through a set up routine including turning the speakers on and off and unplugging the router and waiting for it to reconnect In the end the Sonos rep I spoke with acknowledged the speakers cannot connect stably to my Spectrum router SAX1V15 new last winter There is no work around Apparently no Sonos products work wirelessly with my Spectrum router They can be connected by wire but only if they have a port for a wired connection The sound quality is nevertheless amazing for portable speakers of this size Enjoy every Sonos speaker I have The Move is amazing battery Bluetooth and sounds as good as Sonos 1 The Roam is blah Nothing more Pay double and buy Move or pay half and buy a Wonderboom 2 or Megaboom 3 FYI scoring this a one because there is no zero or negative I have a Sonos system with 3 amps and a port so I bought the roam speaker last year to keep the ecosystem Ever since I bought it it s been having issues with WiFi connectivity It disconnects randomly after about 2 or 3 days I have to reboot the device to reconnect it I finally called sonos tech support and spent close an hour on the phone with them Even shared my screen so the guy can see my Router settings Long story short he told me I have to call Netgear and ask how to get access to UPNP setting on the Router so I can disable it Do not buy this speaker It will frustrate your life Sonos needs to own up and let people know this is a defective device I m tossing mine and never buying any Sonos product again I have a huge pool area and it works well but not made for large areas and large crowds This was not a easy item to set up and could not get anyhelp from company so returned Not knowing there wouldbe a 5 37 restocking fee never have had this happen throughamazon before Just through the Company Beware I can put it next to the router and it drops off randomly OR it just won t connect even though it shows on the SONOS app as connected I LOVE SONOS products so I wasn t expecting this had I not tossed out the box accidently I would return it Do yourself a favor and read up on the troubling software that Sonos is putting out right now I have two Roams both are useless Do not update the Sonos App The ego on these folks sorry if you are like me and already bought Going from WiFi to Bluetooth connectivity is an absolute pain in the ass I ll never buy another Sonos product again Do yourself a favor and buy JBL Bluetooth speakers They connect every single time in seconds Sonos is a completeFailure when it comes to seamless connections Great sound Not easy at all to add to system I love the tone quality of the Sonos Roam Really big sound in a small package But using the Roam requires you to recharge the battery after nearly every use It s portable It supports both Bluetooth and WiFi But the WiFi sucks the life out of the battery I have 9 Sonos speakers including a Move before purchasing the Roam Since connecting it to my system it has caused severe disruptions to my previously stable home experience It is never Connected even though its charging closest to my router and when it is paired with the rest of the system if it actually is connected the rest of my home setup will not work There is a major flaw with the protocols in this device Do not add one to your existing home setup I did not have any of these problems when I added a Move a year prior I own a sonos roam and pleased with the quality of it I ordered a second one and Amazon send me a used one unacceptable Great speaker Clear and spaced sound Great for golf cart While in the shower I like music and this device meets safety concerns in a moist environment great battery life and a great sound Takes up little space on the vanity surface Use it with Alexa Great option for taking the SONOS music out to the patio up to another room or just in the background of my home office The connection was super easy and it just works sound quality is also amazing for such a small thing The Ultimate Ears BOOM 3 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker is small but powerful It s easy to pack and bring with you making it an essential item during my recent move The speaker easily connects to my iPhone and plays music and podcasts with ease Its compact size is convenient but can make it easy to misplace when you re busy moving so keep it nearby and charged so you can easily find it Extremely satisfied with the battery life These UE Boom 3 speakers sound great They party up feature works flawlessly Does not take much for them to be loud Only thing that could be improved is the renaming of the Bluetooth device When you rename in your Bluetooth settings that name does not transfer over to the UE App or vice versa So you have to rename the same device in two different places Sight inconvenience but for the sound and quality not worried about it Would definitely purchase again This is a great item Great sound and easy to use and setup great sound and size very portable Great speaker for price and size Lacks the crisp sound and bass of the ue boom 2 I am a dumy when it comes to tech First attempt to connect with phone not successful Second attempt YES I listen all the time now and can walk around the house and do outside some outside chores without wearing my phone everywhere Holds a charge for a pretty long time Glad I got this Rec from a friend After a little over a year of use the rechargeable battery died on Boom 3 I have cheaper rechargeable speakers that have lasted years compared to Boom 3 Severely disappointed Kudo s to Logitech support Amazon provided a contact number and Logitech promised to send a replacement I ve changed the rating to reflect their attentive customer service The media could not be loaded I have two opinions of the Ultimate Ears Boom speakers When used as a single speaker the Ultimate Ears Boom 3 speaker works well The sound quality and loudness are good for a speaker of its size The Bluetooth range is rather pathetic as I lose connection after moving about 20 feet away from the speaker s audio source but I blame Bluetooth for being a lousy wireless standard more than the speaker for that fault The speaker can be used every day in the shower with no negative repercussions Overall the Boom 3 speaker is a great speaker when used by itself The situation completely changes when attempting to use two or more Boom speakers together I ll go into details below but I can confidently say that I ve experienced few pieces of technology that are more unreliable and frustrating than the Boom 3 speakers when trying to get them paired together and playing the same audio First the Ultimate Ears Boom app is a huge frustration Getting even a single speaker to show up in the app can require multiple disconnects app force quits and speaker restarts Once a primary speaker shows up in the UE Boom app getting other speakers to show up is near impossible Each and every day I want to use the speakers together I have to go through a 20 minute process of forgetting Bluetooth settings repairing and powering off and on speakers It is such a frustrating process that I usually rage quit and forgo using the speakers together Then once the speakers are connected together they regularly start clicking and thumping as they stutter during audio playback Even when I move the two speakers within a foot of each other and the audio source they regularly and constantly stutter and lose bits of audio Listening to an entire song without missing parts is impossible when using the Ultimate Ears Boom speakers together in Party Up or Two Up mode Simply put THESE SPEAKERS DO NOT WORK WHEN PAIRED TOGETHER The Boom speakers are completely worthless when used together as the audio they play is unlistenable I really enjoyed the single Ultimate Ears Boom speaker I used on its own for about two years but after experiencing the disaster which is Party Up mode and the Ultimate Ears Boom app I will never again purchase another Ultimate Ears product This experience has just been too frustrating and I ve wasted 300 on two speakers I cannot use together Let me start by saying before buying this product I have been a HUGE longtime fan of the Ultimate Ears brand I purchased the original Wonderboom portable bluetooth speaker maybe 5 years ago or longer I originally purchased it because I wanted something waterproof that I could use in the shower It was GREAT for that purpose and also proved to be an awesome all around portable bluetooth speaker Sound quality was great for the price range and size Volume was SUPER as well I loved the big loop on the back that you could hang on all sorts of things I LOVE the concept of the Magic Button in the center to Play Pause Skip The Skip Feature is ESPECIALLY hard to find on a speaker in this price range and I love it for use at work when I may not be able to easily access my phone Bluetooth connection was great Battery life originally lasted anywhere between 4 6hrs at least which was great THIS SPEAKER LASTED ME AT LEAST 5 YEARS with little to no change in quality I LOVED THIS SPEAKER Unfortunately I left it at work one week when I was on vacation and just left it there figuring my coworkers could use it and would respect it enough Long story short I came back and it wasn t working as well or holding a charge properly It was a sad end to a good story Finally I find myself in need of a new speaker Because I LOVED my original WONDERBOOM so much I decided to search within the Ultimate Ears line It also just so happens at my current job our department owns two WONDERBOOM2 speakers I ve noticed their battery life doesn t work as well but they still worked pretty decent So I wanted one of the newest nicest speakers in the Ultimate Family The Hyperboom was too large to transport from home and work and cost way more than I was looking to spend so that was out of the question So immediately I decided to research between the BOOM3 the MEGABOOM3 In conclusion through reviews I read I concluded that most consumers felt the bass was overpowering for the Megaboom3 with no real volume increase and simply diminished the quality of the sound SO I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE BOOM3 1 First impression out of the box it looked nice enough I preferred the more compact design of the Wonderboom and DEFINITELY missed the larger more practical loop It still has the magic button which is a HUGE selling point to me and very accommodating I charged it up to 100 and decided to unplug it and test it out for a while at home It worked well sounded almost exactly like the Wonderboom as far as sound QUALITY I might be wrong but as far as VOLUME goes I feel it may have had the same volume limitations as the original Wonderboom if anything maybe SLIGHTLY louder However I was happy it seemed to be fully functioning and worked just as well as my other one I also liked that in addition to that I was able to use the Ultimate Ears app in conjunction with the product to REMOTE START the speaker from my phone Again this is another HUGE selling point to me because I mainly use this product at work It also has an EQUALIZER function which is definitely cool although I don t feel like it s very accurate It also has some sort of feature where you can set certain clicks on the Magic Button to play certain playlists automatically which sounds cool although I never got to personally try it All in all it seemed like a good replacement at first THE NEXT DAY COMES HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEMS BEGIN I come into work with my charger FULLY charged at 100 I use Remote Start on the app to turn on the speaker The Remote Start feature also displays the approximate battery percentage by 10 increments of the speaker At this point my speaker was at 100 charge I used the speaker for between 1 5hrs 2hrs before it gave me the Low Battery warning for 10 So I put it on the charger and continued to let it play It lasted maybe another 20minutes before it died Now this is VERY disappointing considering my ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM that came out 5 years ago would last for 4 6hrs on FULL VOLUME without being on a charger Not only that but the ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM would ALSO last for a WHILE on the charger even when battery wasn t full This was disappointing but didn t seem like a crisis just a bit sad The next day is when the BIGGER issue began I admittedly forgot to charge my BOOM3 when I got home the night before and then brought it to work When I wake up I charge it until I leave for 1 5HOURS When I arrive at work I charge it for an additional 1HOUR before checking the battery percentage on the app which reads 60 So I decide to turn it on and use it while STILL LEAVING IT ON THE CHARGER NOT EVEN 30 MINUTES GO BY UNTIL THE SPEAKER DIES So irritated I turn it off opt for my AirPods and leave the speaker to charge for a few hours I let this SPEAKER CHARGE FOR 4 MORE HOURS BEFORE USING IT Finally I check the battery on the app which only says 40 So I turn on the speaker and leave it plugged in IT LASTS FOR LESS THAN ONE SONG BEFORE DYING LET ME TELL YOU THIS SPEAKER BROUGHT OUT PURE RAGE IN ME AT WORK I feel so pissed and cheated and ripped off I was such a big fan and advocate for the Ultimate Ears brand but how are you gonna sell me a NEWER MORE EXPENSIVE speaker and MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY worse Considering this is the BOOM3 I WOULD HOPE ASSUME IT IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL WONDEBOOM FROM 5 YEARS AGO BUT I GUESS NOT Thanks Logitech just charge me more money for a FAR INFERIOR PRODUCT with the illusion that is going to be somewhat improved However this speaker is simply for my needs UNUSABLE FRUSTRATING HUUUUUGE DOWNGRADE Very very disappointed in the Ultimate Ears brand for putting out this one Like I sad it really is a shame because I was a HUGE supporter of their brand and unfortunately this product was so disappointing and frustrating that it has ruined my relationship with this company for good I loved the convenience of the Magic Button with the Skip Feature the portability durability great waterproof technology super big useful loop the sound quality volume and the battery life of ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM but this product has ruined all that unfortunately DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SAVE YOUR MOMEY BECAUSEYOU WILL NEED TO RETURN IT REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER SPEAKER THIS SPEAKER IS NOT FUNCTIONAL Sorry Ultimate Ears but do better I was curiously cautious about the sound this would provide because it is a small speaker but it did not disappoint When paired with my phone it s easy to adjust the volume and sound Definitely worth the money Easy to pair easy to use great accessory to have around the house Sound is good will link to my other one Love the sound quality I ve added this speaker to my sound system of other Ultimate Ears speakers and I am not disappointed Thinking about purchasing one more Great sounding blue tooth speaker and very easy to pair Love the purple and sounds good What a great speaker The sound is amazing Had a little issue hooking to blutooth the first time Now its hooks up instantly I recommend this speaker My son has had one for five years and has had no issues Compact with great sound I love this speaker very good sound quality very loud keep battery for long time Water proof alway plus Improved my living quality Sound quality is great Connects easily to Bluetooth with the right connection assessory I expected the speaker given the dimensions to not put out as much quality sound as it does I can say that I was pleasantly surprised that the music for my daughter s pool party was perfect and the battery lasted for the entire party I was surprised of the full tonal range produced by this small object Rivals my traditional amplifier and standup speaker system Using it in my living room only The Bluetooth speaker sound was crystal clear and the volume control made it easy to determine the level of sound needed to make the listening enjoyable bought for personal parties great item arrived as described Bought this for boat and jet ski use The sound is great lightweight and no issue with the waterproof But at 100 battery life only held charge less than 5 6 hours Sounds great Better than I expected I thought I ordered the MegaBoom3 to replace my stolen one Sigh it is a smaller version Is a fine speaker but not with the Bass and presence of the Big Brother Also what was advertised to be purple was pink My least liked color I will likely order againand be sure it is the one I am wanting this time Out of the box it sounds OK A little E Q goes a long way I work in a machine shop and this Speaker gets plenty loud It feels quite rugged so no problems there The odd choice is micro usb The lack of usb c is egregious this must be to push towards their convenient charger If sound quality over volume is your thing look elsewhere Again for a workshop environment its pretty good We had the original speaker for years and just started to have some issues We love our new upgrade speaker Replaced my old JBL Charge To my untrained ear this is a great replacement Size is perfect very protable volume and quality is perfect I have been using this speaker now for a year in my car My car is so old that I can t connect it to my phone so I thought I should get myself a speaker A friend recommend me the Boom 3 and then I got it Sound quality It is quite decent It is not sensational but still very good Therefore 4 stars Bluetooth connectivity It has its issues every now and then but it can be fixed with a few clicks here and there Battery life The only downside is the battery life It doesn t last that long I can use it for 6 hours but will then have to recharge I would still recommend this product though It is easy to use Interference near the microwawe or other electrric devices Sounds terrible with the interference Sometimes it is hard to connect three of them especially if one is outside de house I tried to returned but I could after one month I have several boom 3 speakers in the house They sound great and I plan on adding more This Bluetooth speaker does what it says it will do Very happy and I m excited to know that you can pair more than one together I just broke my last UE boom that I had for 9 years It only broke because of me This one arrived today boom3 and it s better than the last one in every way It arrived brand new in an undamaged box all the plastic was in place It sounds terrific it s absolutely beautiful and the update to the buttons and charging port location are exactly what it needed Time will tell if the quality stands up to their high standards from 9 years ago but I ll update my review if needed Good little speaker but somewhat lacking in bass response perhaps the model that has enhanced bass would have been more to my liking but i m still happy with this one We bought this to provide better sound than can be provided from a phone and it s delivered We re basic when it comes to tech we just wanted something to listen to outside in the yard while enjoying drinks or dinner in city life and this does just that Highs and midranges are fine as could be expected but bass is surprisingly good for its small size Admittedly we don t use it every day and when we do it s maybe an hour or two I would guess we use it 2 3 times a week tops and I am blown away that at that rate its initial charge lasted us 7 months At this rate I d buy again in a heartbeat Not super durable in the sun at the beach ours blew the speakers when hot but we love it so much this is our third one Great product with respect to battery waterproofing and tech Would buy again and again I found wonderboom at target on clearance and I should have bought them all When it wouldn t take a charge anymore I looked to upgrade My bf wanted one too because he was so impressed with my old one So we upgraded to the boom 3 got 2 One was perfect the other didn t charge Such easy replacement from Amazon got it the next day This one is perfect You can pair them together to get stereo sound The sound is phenomenal pairing is so simple One of the best speakers out there I have chosen it over Bose everyday and I am a Bose girl If you want immense sound and need it to be easy get any of the wonderboom products The app is new to me and I need to work with it but I use my Amazon music on it and just party like it s 1999 in my bathroom getting ready for work Get the warranty which I didn t but should have because when it decides to not charge you will be sad and anxious for a new one I have had my 1st one for 5 years I dropped it regularly and no problems I use it in the bathroom next to the sink because it is waterproof The charging dock I haven t seen it really charge yet but I could be doing it wrong But the cord is easy peasy I love my boom 3 and will stick with Ultimate ears for years to come You can pair I think up to 20 with the boom 3 I can t imagine how awesome that will sound Hope this helps You will love it I went to a Best Buy to look at portable bluetooth speakers I was able to compare bluetooth speakers from Bose JBL and Ultimate Ears Of all the speakers I listened to at this size and price point this had the best sound Best Buy didn t have any BOOM 3 speakers in stock so I ordered from Amazon Its been a definite upgrade from my previous similarly sized portable bluetooth speaker with stronger bass hits and bigger sound overall The bigger and more expensive speakers I listened to sounded better for sure but the BOOM 3 does great for a more affordable speaker of its size Its no audiophile speaker It s tuned for popular music with particular emphasis on bass and percussive hits Which is fine since that s what I was looking for and expecting from a speaker of this size and price It does a decent job with today s top 40 style music I don t listen to much rap or R B but I think it would do great with those genres as well Music like Olivia Rodriguez s Good 4 U was pretty satisfying to listen to Ultimate ears even provides an app where you can EQ the sound to something that you personally like even better Music like Tightrope from the Greatest Showman soundtrack or Zanarkand from Final Fantasy Distant Worlds was a different story They sounded muddy and lacked detail in a very unsatisfying way I don t thing the EQ app can do anything to help that out You ll want a different speaker if you re looking for a speaker for vocal orchestral jazz etc Really like this speaker We went on a trip and forgot to bring our old speaker and this one was on sale It really kicks Great 360 sound and you can pair them with other UE speakers One thing I wish the speaker would tell you when the battery is like 1 4 full It will tell you when it s almost empty but that s not helpful if you re in the middle of a movie TL DR had one for 3 years until it started cutting in and out so I got a new one and it started cutting in and out after only 3 weeks of use The inconsistent quality is frustrating and I will be looking for a different speaker now I originally bought one in 2020 and it lasted me 3 years of almost daily use until it started cutting in and out It would play music and then briefly cut out and back in like a hiccup every few minutes I found it pretty annoying so I ordered a new one This one was even worse as it started cutting in and out like the last one but after only 3 weeks of use I initiated a return and hopefully I can get it because I threw the box away after I opened it After 2 of the same speaker I would say I don t really recommend this one because while my first one did last me 3 years and was great it seems that the quality of them is inconsistent so I will be looking for a different one soon I just got this yesterday and so far I like it alot The sound quality seems very good Charging via USB seems a bit slow but I will receive the charging dock tomorrow and assume that will be much better I thought the description said it works with many music apps It seems to work only with Amazon Music and iTunes neither of which I use any more I use Spotify and it does not sync to that but not a problem for me I simply control it from my phone I like the look of this speaker and its small size makes it easy to place in a room or outdoors Overall I think it s excellent Likes SmallPortableYou can push the plus and minus keys and it tells you how much charge is leftEasy connectivity to blue toothExcellent SoundYou can turn it on and off from the app on your phone Dislikes Hmm Sometimes I forget where I took the thing so I have to go hunting I like how you can pair with other boom speakers very easy to use with the app Battery life better than expected This is the second Boom 3 I have purchased since the first of the year and I hope the speaker drivers don t fail after 2 months like the first one Additionally the Bluetooth can be tricky to set up with your media devices if you have previously paired another Boom 3 The media could not be loaded I bought this speaker cause i heard good thing about it i get the Boom 3 my friend told me to get the megaboom but i get the small one i was so excited i get it one day before my birthday and next day we was going to the beach to celebrate i put the speaker to charge but i didn t check if really was charging new product why to check well next day 2 hours later when the party begins the speaker died i was really upset all day on my birthday i had a portable charger and wasn t working came home put it to charge and nothing i try other cable other plug and nothing I contact Amazon customer service and they replaced for a new one Today 05 26 put the new speaker to charge and is charging so far sound beautiful but is too early to give them 5 Star i will change the start when i am confident that is a really good product Updat today 03 21 2024 almost two year I get this speaker I will give them 5 stars cause this radio speaker still perfect still sound nice and battery life is great I bought other one cause u can connect other speaker through the Boom app in the same channel and play music together It said is waterproof well yes it is I am really bad and put the speaker inside of my pool ofcourse will sound horrible but I took it out and the speaker still good and sounding beautiful Advertised As fifteen hours battery life I m lucky if this even last four hours I have the first Boom that is still working after 10 years I recently upgraded to a new phone and the Bluetooth connection wasn t great I decided to get a newer version As with my previous model the sound quality and the waterproofing are great This model is a bit bigger The battery life is good however I wish they would include the plug and not just the cable USB I m using the plug from my older model The main reason why I bought another Boom is because I liked my first model I bought this speaker back in 2021 and this speaker has never doubted me Decent battery life water resistant but I took it to the extremes last night I accidentally knocked my speaker into my laundry load on a heavy cycle with pre soak and once my laundry was done Pulled out my linens and I saw the speaker I was absolutely stunned Turned it on AND IT STILL WORKS This is your sign to buy this speaker I will only be buying speakers from this brand for now on I still cannot believe it works plus it smells good now too I like my new speaker Sound quality is good and it looks like it can last a good while Didn t know you had the ability to replace batteries if they go bad I like that one is able to do that Works great Charge lasts a long time can be paired with other UE speakers for a broader range of sound I dislike it did not come with the charger how do I charge it The pictures make it look like it is much bigger than it is I returned it and bought the megaboom model Connecting two or more speakers can be tricky at first but once you figure it out works Great Excellent speakers Would recommend I have three of these and create my own surround sound with them They are easy to travel with and the sound quality whether you have one or three is superb I am very happy with these Nice clear mids decent bass in an attractive device make this an all around winner On the negative side there s a mostly unnecessary app oversized volume buttons and a I d prefer it had a USB C power connector instead of the old micro connector Over all this is a great speaker It also looks really nice and feels solid in hand The UE is small light enough that I use it as my travel speaker although I prefer the boom ier bass on my heavier JBL for workout and party music at home This speaker sounds good but not obtrusive natural for various genres The default tuning is fine Unusual for a Bluetooth speaker there is an EQ feature on the app but it doesn t let you turn one band up without decreasing the others Good for tuning the sound quality for eg spoken podcasts but you can t turn up the bass or the treble like you might on a usual sound system The app also allows using the speaker s top smart button to automatically launch playlists without otherwise interacting with a device A clever idea but since I usually use an AI like Google Assistant I find it unnnecessary and better to not have too many random apps installed The speaker works beautifully without the app totally optional I used to buy Logitech PC speakers long ago and they still make good gaming speakers It s interesting Logi acquired Ultimate Ears a brand I hadn t heard of before A good move on their part as this is one of the two best speakers I tested recently in my search for the perfect hardware Highly Recommended I have owned a different UE speaker before so I knew they were good but I absolutely love the sound quality of this model I ve only used it indoors so far but I will be using it outdoors when the weather gets better Good all around speaker Can take it everywhere This is my second one because I use it in the garage hot tub and classic beetle Tried of going to find it so I bought this one I own a UE Mega Blast and a Mega Boom 3 which both work great Purchased a Boom 3 and worked well for 2 weeks Paired it in party up mode with Mega Boom and a day later went to use the Boom 3 wouldn t pair in Bluetooth and UE Boom app wouldn t connect Talked with Amazon tech support with no luck in getting to pair Was in return window so returned speaker Had zero problems with my other UE speakers that I ve had for 2 years Going to purchase another Boom 3 to see if I have better luck UE makes great sounding speakers with good battery life I ve been putting this speaker through its paces for the last few hours and I m really impressed Sound quality water resistance and build quality is all there The app is well designed pairing is quick and easy and bluetooth range covers my entire apartment It s important to understand that you re not gonna get crazy sub bass on this thing but that s not what they re trying to do here One thing I really have to hand it to UE for on this speaker is instead of trying to reproduce frequencies in those bottom sub ranges they have obviously set a hard shelf on the EQ that totally eliminates those frequencies from the mix rather than try to make the small speakers in this unit try for it anyway A lot of other bluetooth speakers I ve heard fail pretty hard at that and you end up with distortion and a lot of muddiness in the low range because of it The tradeoff is that especially low end music namely drum and bass dubstep 808 heavy hip hop and trap etc isn t going to exactly shine on this speaker What does sound great though is just about everything else that doesn t rely on sub bass Rock jazz metal most hip hop most electronic funk r b podcasts etc all sound really clear and have great dynamics This speaker is also capable of going extremely loud I couldn t get it past around 70 volume in my apartment without it being excessive yet the music sounded totally clear and free of distortion even when I cranked it Also I brought it in the shower to test and it got wet without issue and dried off quickly I just got the speaker so time will tell how reliable it is but count me as impressed I m looking forward to taking this on river floats next summer Really happy that well made waterproof electronics are readily available now That was by far one of the biggest selling points to me after the sound quality They should have used USB C that s maybe my biggest gripe I ve never cared for micro USB When I lost my old Boom 2 I decided to upgrade to this Boom 3 It was really simple to connect as I already had the app installed It s got really great full bodied sound for such a little speaker just like the Boom 2 did The fact that it s waterproof really made using it out by the pool or at the lake a stress free experience Two thumbs up The only thing that makes no sense sense to me is why it still uses the old mini USB instead of the new USB C Maybe it s a voltage thing I don t know but I really think they should have updated that That being said it s got great battery life so far This is our second UE boom speaker We liked the first one so much we figured we d buy a second one to link them together and have music everywhere at our house Well the new speaker gets very crackly and the speaker can t be further than 20 away from each other or they don t work I can hear the first speaker perfectly fine at 20 Kind of defeats the purpose of they must be so close to each other I had the speaker for 9 months and it had a power charging issue on a Saturday and shut down I contacted the company on Monday and spoke to Zaniah I told her it would not charge and I tried all the steps changing the power cord and adapter switched outlets etc Within 10 minutes she emailed me the claim instructions I had the information back to her in an hour and received the new speaker Friday morning Zaniah emailed me daily with updates on the status Absolutely excellent response from the company Totally recommend the Boom 3 speaker as not only does it sound great but the company stands 100 behind their product The clear and powerful sound and its easy setup make this BT speaker a must have for all those who want to have a high level music speaker I definitely would buy it again and again Quick connectivity to my cell phone I take it everywhere A bit heavy to carry around though It would be nice to have some kind of hip holder so I dont have to carry it around in my hand Bought one for my pastor and he loves it Great gift for any occaision I lost my previous one and was so lost without it within in 2 days of losing the other one I bought this one and bought it because it would overnighted I love this little monster I used to listen to podcasts on my iPhone sometimes sticking it in a glass for better sound The BOOM 3 was easy to connect to Bluetooth has long battery life and the sound quality is great Now I listen to music audiobooks sleep sounds etc on my Ultimate Ears Boom 3 and love it It s easy to turn on off and adjust the volume with my phone keeping the push buttons on the unit from being overused This speaker worked great for about 6 months The sound was good and so was the Bluetooth range and the battery life is really good It has notification sounds that play really loud but you can turn them off so that s not a big deal until you can t turn them off or the speaker 6 months in the magic button got stuck It was always a little touchy but it worked and I never paid it any mind but once it got stuck none of the other buttons worked anymore The volume and power buttons no longer responded because the magic button was constantly being pressed There is an app and I could turn the power off that way but minutes later the power was back on because the magic button was depressed It took days for the battery to run down and at certain intervals it would announce that some feature was not available and to check the aps internet connection really loudly When the battery finally ran down it started screaming that the battery was low every 30 seconds i had to stash it out in the garage I contacted support and they got back to me saying the warranty doesn t cover the stuck magic button because it was damaged the kicker is I never said the speaker was damaged only that the button was stuck Since it was no longer covered I found a tutorial on how to take it apart and found that the screws that hold the switch in place were so tight that the switch didn t have room to release I loosened the screws and the speaker is back to working like it should except it s no longer waterproof That sounds like a manufacturing defect to me I let Logitech support know what I found and we ll see what they have to say I would have given the speaker 5 stars but the business with support knocks it down a couple notches in my opinion I bought one from best buy before this one and there is a noticeable difference in sound quality The difference in price was only 20 not much When the volume is more than half there is noticeable distortion not present on the other one I haven t noticed any thing special about the soundI prefer the JBL to this Thought it was gonna be louder It s decent The good Amazing battery life Seems to run forever even at max volume Decent sound you can t expect too much from such a small unit but the volume is pretty loud and bass is decent for the size Portable perfect for traveling No issues with bluetooth connectivityThe bad Uses micro USB charging seriously Overall I would recommend this as a portable speaker to use while traveling My husband loves it It is portable and very good sound Charges fast For my purposes this is perfect This stays in my car for kayaking sometimes biking when in a group party s golfing working in the garage you get it Things I love the size the battery usb C would have been greatly appreciated the controls yes it really floats but the speaker is under water while it does not really usable in a pool or spa and it seems to be built VERY solid The sound is a little better than average and that s comparing it to my best sounding Sony and a very nice Bose that both stay in or close to the house I m not a snob when it comes to portable speakers great sound is achieved under controlled circumstances with much better equipment this is good for what it is The app is nice but doesn t add a lot for me I can get most of the functions it provides elsewhere except for the battery level nice to check before heading out for a day or weekend The only small flaw I ve found to date is the lack of being able to answer a phone call with it I m torn on how important of a feature that really is but it feels like they could have added it and still kept their minimal clean very simple controls in tact I m very happy with this speaker and it s sort of become my go to it s beating out a number of very nice options The sound was good while it lasted Issues that may concern potential buyers 1 My Boom3 stopped charging after about a month It doesn t come with a power adapter Their instructions and FAQ say to charge using any USB power adapter I charged it using a surge protector with built in USB ports The tiny white charging indicator light has stopped lighting up The device can recognize that it s plugged into an outlet but it won t charge I can t use the speaker anymore and when I try to turn it on the voice just says Charging please wait I ve tried other plugs and cords but no luck I m just outside the Amazon return window sucks because I want a refund so I ll have to check if the company will exchange or credit it under warranty 2 Was hoping to use it with my PC but audio keeps cutting out even though speaker is right next to the case I tried the troubleshooting tips in their FAQ multiple times followed other user threads and tips but never got it working well All other bluetooth products I have including noise cancelling headphones and testing it with my spouse s JBL speaker worked fine I even unpaired and forgot everything then reconnected only the the Boom3 still cutting out at regular intervals This is a pre built gaming PC and only a few years old so I really don t think it s the PC s fault I found numerous people online with similar issues 3 The cord that comes with this for charging is disappointing It is micro USB which means it is awkward to insert Why not use USB C on a newer product like this The cord is solid white so it looks garish plugged into my black Boom 3 Also the plug housing is a big square but the Boom3 charge slot is inside an oval recess it s very snug and awkward to plug in Finally the cord is a flat ribbon style it does not want to go where you want it to go At first the Boom 3 didn t turn on for more than five seconds I was just about to return until a Amazon video suggested resetting the device I believe it was push the volume minus button and the power button at the same time That did the trick I installed the phone app and chose the more bass selection on one of the automatic equalizer selections The equalizer produced much improved sound quality in my opinion I got this to pair with my TV and all I have to do to pair it up after the initial pairing is to push the magic button and it responds instantly Good product weather resistant The micro usb port caught me off guard I tried jamming the USB C cable for about 1 minute Sorry but to ship a micro usb product is just lazy at this point Also I do not like the sound It s muddy in the middle to highs Update Replaced it with a Flip 6 I like the sound much better Much clearer but not quite as good as my Soundlink Mini 2 though Wanted to give high mark 5stars but unit stop charging after only 3mo I m currently going through warranty process with UE now Went to Amazon with my problem they handed me over to UE After several attempts to do what UE wanted me to do ie Troubleshooting Now had to take pictures of unit pdf format order from Amazon 14 emails back forth with UE hopefully they will get back to me with good news More to come all in all the UE speakers have great sound Update UE finally shipped out a replacement speaker 1st person from UE dropped the ball with all the emails back and forth 2nd person from UE handled the situation more swiftly Got my replacement speaker in less than 4 days after speaking with 2nd rep from UE All good no problems with replacement speaker However I think that some items should be brought from the manufacturer not here I have another UE speaker from Amazon the battery dies so fast The speaker isn t even a year old So moving forward I will buy with more caution What happened to UE They used to have great bluetooth speakers I just read that they were bought by Altec Lansing which explains the drop in sound quality I owned a UE Boom 1st model and 2nd model and they were amazing So of course I would buy this model the 3rd gen Well I was disappointed First it is not LOUD like the previous models Bass is sub par but then again UE wasnt really know for heavy bass So first I tried the volume at Max outside to see how it was It was decent but not loud like the other gens 2nd issue is u will need to download their app to get the most of the speaker but even the app provides minimal improvements Battery life is better I will say but aound just isnt what it used to be I would send it back but I gave away my other 2 gens to friends when I ordered this Do yourself a favor Buy a bose link instead because this doesnt do it And the 360 immersive sound that it claims is definitely missing Disappointed in this speaker to say the least 1 Great sounds 2 Designed for fools like me Just plug it in and download the app Nice lady on the speaker leads you through it Then connect through settings on Bluetooth That s it Love this thing Bluetooth connection to my Boom 3 speakers is sub par and unacceptable for something in this price range I own two identical speakers which were bought at separate times and have the issue with both The problem is that the Bluetooth connection randomly cuts in out similar to a popping Happening in different environments with different transmitting devices and also in daisy chain connections which is so bad that I can not use multiple speakers together The problem is not consistent I have checked the firmware level in the Boom app and it shows it is up to date My two speakers experience the issue at all distances from the phone which range from sitting on the device next to the device and then any distance range until it s to far to maintain connection The issue comes and goes and has been happening more lately which is driving my dissatisfaction and this review I really wanted this to be a good purchase so have given multiple chances for them to work at an acceptable level I do not recommend the Boom 3 to anyone unless you get a serious discount and do not expect consistent sound I ll definitely try another brand when I get so fed up with these that I just donate them away Side note it seems like BT can be spiritic on other speakers too so perhaps it s worth it to just get a speaker that offers a hard connection to avoid the frustrating situations when you want consistent sound over portability I absolutely LOVED the previous iteration of this product It lasted at a high quality level for 4 years I by no means expected the more expensive update to last a fraction of the time I LOVE music I say this as a record producer mixing engineer songwriter and artist I am almost always listening to music and from the last iteration of the speaker to this one I used this one less however the low end is shaky and makes most of the music I listen to sound muddy I do not use it around a pool or get it wet hardly at all It stays next to the sink when I shower and in my room Would I be able to get this product replaced Appreciate you reading I truly feel that I may have revived a speaker that needed a lil more love in the manufacturing process This is a great travel speaker with one big flaw The damn thing charges via micro USB This is inexcusable and requires me to carry around an extra charging cable specifically for this device Our previously speaker lasted more than a decade and I expect this one will too Perfect for my hubby and I I have always loved the UE boom and rec it to all my friends Its great when everyone brings there s to the beach or a party and we can sync them up I have the megaboom and finally caught the boom on sale Great to link up Highly recommend This speaker sounds good with computer Other than that unless you have the latest Bluetooth on your cell there s always a problem pairing for Party Up feature and sound output only gives about half the output potential I tried on several cell phones If you can test before buying try for yourself We love this speaker We use it by the pool for outdoor parties and in the golf cart Would definitely recommend this I listen mostly to jazz in the background while I m reading or on the web usually at low volume sometimes rock at louder volumes I ve bought any number of blue tooth speakers as a hobby I suppose always in search of that nirvana sound They ve ranged from really small Fugoo units with unbelievably good sound to paired floor standing auditorium behemoths that will blow your contacts out IMO the UE Boom 3 s are not only a good value they are superlative in sound from low to high ranges at easy and medium volume Great for voice too e g podcasts I have 2 paired and will likely buy another pair stereo is nice for another room I recently tried the UE Megablast and they don t hold a candle to to crispness and range of the Boom 3 s They re loud and have some nice control features but for sound IMO the 3 s are the best by far and uncannily the least expensive of over 10 other brands up to 300 Unless you re filling a large room with loud music I d say the Boom is the best speaker in it s portable class Enjoy and don t worry about missing any sound you ll pleasantly hear it all The speaker is great for about 2 hours After that it dies Mine is about 3 months old Very good sound especially with the equalizer available in the app Plenty of volume I use it on a warehouse forklift Super portable Practically indestructible as I traveled all throughout Alaska and tossed this guy in rivers and off mountains It remains giving amazing audio quality and fast connectivity Will only ever buy UE for my music needs This speaker is the best Boom ever made It sounds great is functional and durable The controls are way better starting and stopping the sound is just an actual button and you can even fast forward too I have docked one star from this clear 5 star speaker because the battery indicator is broken unless you download the UE Boom App and update the firmware Before I did this the battery never got past 20 I looked on the internet and that seems to be a common problem that is fixed by a firmware update which requires the app To me that is a shady practice People should download the app if they want not because they literally have no choice because the battery indicator is broken without it I know I can delete the app now and I will but it s just a lame way to get downloads Otherwise this speaker is absolutely amazing and it hurts to not give it 5 stars TLDR Great sound quality great portability and size and holds a good charge 5 6 hours at 50 70 volume The charging cradle is a must own if you buy this It s durable and holds up well but it can dent and ding with relative ease but it doesn t effect the sound quality I got more than 5 years out of my first one and it still works The Bose app is great and easy to link multiple devices Where this speaker absolutely shines is in Party Mode Stereo Mode It actually gives my Bose Smart Soundbar 900 a run Only possible with two of these revolve in Stereo Mode however you can link any other Bose Soundlink speakers to it as well Silver hides dirt better than the black but the black handle hides dirt better than the silver handle The black also hides dents and dings a little better One downside is the charging cradle only comes in black If you can wait patiently and would like to save some money you can find this around 100 off retail during black Friday sales Amazon Day sales and during random flash sales The first one I owned was a Silver Soundlink Revolve that I used daily for roughly 5 years Then after getting a PC and finding out my monitor didn t have speakers I decided I wanted one more to connect with my PC since I was always moving my silver series 1 back and forth But after seeing how effortlessly it connects to bluetooth and being able to tell a difference in the quality of sound from heavy everyday use for 5 years I felt like it would bother me Before I hadn t noticed it but after comparing them directly and using party mode stereo mode linking them I could tell my silver OG soundlink revolve was just a touch not as clear If both were new I m pretty sure the only difference between the two would be the ease of bluetooth connection on the series 2 this one The battery is pretty much about the same in my experience but honestly I leave it on the cradle 95 of the time If I had to guess I d say the Series 2 might be slightly better overall but I m inclined to think it has more with the software than a battery upgrade However it s nice to grab and walk through the house from chore to chore while listening to an audiobook podcast or other media content As far as portable speakers go I think this is right in the pocket It s compact enough that it s easily packed in a backpack or drawstring bag but it s also loud enough that it s worth carrying with you Honestly some smaller lower quality speakers just aren t really worth the trouble For example my first Jambox or my first JBL portable speaker Those were both pretty mid to be honest neither lasted more than 1 5 years The sound quality is supurb and has a nice overall balance between the high s and bass It s very clear even when it s loud My only recommendation would be to buy the charging cradle as it makes everything so much easier I do feel like for the price it should include the charging cradle but whatever Ultimately I was happy enough with the series 1 Soundlink Revolve that I decided to add another one Then after hearing the sound degradation after 5 years I decided to buy another Honestly without comparing them side by side you d never notice But unfortunately I did and then it always bothered me I decided to retire my OG Silver Soundlink Revolve and gave it to a friend He couldn t believe I would give it away like that but I assured him that I got every penny out of those 5 years He s been using the OG revolve for more than a year now And I ve been using my two Series 2 revolve for more than a year as well Both have held up great even with daily use For reference I usually listen at around 50 70 volume Where this speaker really shines is in Party Mode Stereo Mode with two of these Revolve speakers It honestly gives my Bose Smart Soundbar a good and close run It s a pretty pricy investment but it can be easier to justify knowing you ll easily get 5 years out of it Just don t have it turned up to 100 all the time for hours at a time and it should last you a very long time PS In all honesty I think the Silver hides dirty and grime better than the black does It sounds like the opposite would be true but the black show s every spec of dust and finger prints standout a lot more The only downside was the charging cradle only comes in black The only benefit to the black color in my experience is that the black handle does hide dirt better So it s kind of a trade off I got the black speakers this time around just as a refresher I kinda wanted it to feel new and unfamiliar In all honesty after spending a year with the black I d say personally I prefer the silver But the black does match the cradle and it the handle hides dirt a little better The black also hides dents and dings a little better too but not by much After 5 years with OG revolve it had a number of smaller dents from being knocked around thrown falling off the table desk etc it s made well and you no doubt get what you pay for I treated myself to the Bose SoundLink speaker and am glad I chose this over some other less expensive options I am genuinely blown away by its exceptional performance and versatility THE GOOD Build From the moment I unboxed the Bose SoundLink I was immediately impressed by its sleek and modern design Its compact form factor makes it incredibly portable and the build quality is outstanding The soft touch materials and sturdy construction exude a sense of durability that assures me it s built to last Sound The real magic however lies in its audio performance The SoundLink delivers a rich immersive sound that s hard to believe could come from a speaker of this size The bass response is surprisingly punchy mids are clear and vibrant and the highs are crisp without being harsh Whether I m listening to my favorite music streaming podcasts or watching movies the sound quality is consistently phenomenal Connectivity One feature that sets the SoundLink apart from the competition is its impressive Bluetooth connectivity Pairing my devices is a breeze and the connection remains stable even when I m in another room The wireless range is quite impressive allowing me to move freely without worrying about losing the connection Battery Another standout feature is the battery life I ve used it for hours on end without needing to recharge making it a reliable companion for extended listening sessions or outdoor adventures The convenience of having a portable speaker with such a long lasting battery is a game changer THE MEDIOCRE Charging cable Not a huge deal but not having a USBC on a premium product purchased in 2023 is a miss The micro USB has worked well over the past 6 months but I still would much prefer the new standard USBC cable and can t fathom why it wasn t included in this version of the speaker Voice For a premium speaker in 2023 I also thoguht the voice would be improved and sound more natural Every time I turn this on it automatically connects to my phone and says Connected to The voice it uses to say this seems like it is from 2011 when Siri was introduced It s by no means a deal breaker but my expectation was higher at this pricepoint What truly sets the Bose SoundLink apart though is its remarkable portability I ve taken it on hikes to the beach and even used it at picnics and it has never disappointed The built in handle is a thoughtful addition making it easy to carry and its water resistant design offers peace of mind during unexpected rain showers In summary the Bose SoundLink is a powerhouse of a portable speaker offering impressive sound quality ease of use and incredible portability It has quickly become an essential part of my daily life ensuring that I never compromise on audio quality no matter where I go If you re looking for a portable speaker that delivers outstanding performance look no further The Bose SoundLink is a true gem and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a premium audio experience on the go I got it today I m traveling and I need some good quality sound speakers and this was the best very loud and clear sound beautiful shape and color easy to carry and transport due the light weight simply the best I am not high maintenance and as long as it holds charge I am very pleased I will come back after the trip to give my feedback on that Portable Bose speaker Great performance Easy connectivity Beat deal ever for prime members The media could not be loaded This speaker is the perfect size and has amazing sound quality and battery life It s very easy to connect any device to and is small enough to throw in your bag to take to the beach a cookout or anywhere Can t beat the sound quality for the price Hardy loud and with a very long battery life this is certainly worth the price Connects to phones very easily Main complaint is the synthesized voice that speaks every time you turn it on sounds straight from 2007 and not easy to understand I m a Bose guy for sure This thing was purchased to be used mainly on the beach and at the golf course and it s great for both Long battery and crisp loud music was my goal and I haven t been let down This little speaker is awesome Sounds great Very portable to anywhere Like the fact it s water resistant for the pool and beach I can t believe how much sound it can produce and it sounds great For me it was well worth the money This is the sound that grabs you off the sidewalk and pulls you into an electronic store What was that sound Bose of course I LOVE music and I ve had other speakers I appreciate but BOSE brings the joy When I use this Bose speaker I create my own music world bubble Whatever mood I want to create relaxation energetic dance dream this speaker supports it I live in a crowded city with competing noises trying to intrude on my world No need to fuss I just turn on my Bose and set my auditory boundaries It s peace Oh yeah it s small and light enough to easily carry around The charge lasts hours and hours and it recharges superfast So in case you can t tell I love it and highly recommend it If you re familiar with Bose sound you will not be disappointed with this speaker I use it mainly for my home office and around the apartment if I need a portable speaker And I tested it side by side against a few competing models There really was no competition Cons No USB C This speaker preforms amazing well I have had large top of the line stereo speakers for 30 years and this Bose sounds better thenAnything I have ever heard You would have hear this to believe This product is brand new and has no problem with the sound It can even be said to be very good and worth buying The sound is very clear would highly recommend Worth every penny Bought a JBL and was extremely disappointed This little speaker packs a punch Like the quality of sound and ease of bluetooth connection Is the best speaker with the ideal size Sounds GREAT Great battery life so far Great sound especially for the size My wife loves this speaker great base I ve had them all and was currently using JBL for the past 3 beach seasons JBL is great This season I decided to order 3 speakers and try them out Because of cost I ve never tried Bose and decided to give this one a chance There s no comparison at all The sound quality is excellent I love Bass and this speaker gives it The highs are crisp The battery life is longer than you d ever need This speaker is simply the best Great sound for this litter speaker Love it Sounds great Sound is very clear and soft Highly recommended I really like this speaker It s perfect size to move around in my walker basket The sound is deep as it has a great balance I would definitely recommend it We love it Great sound compact and simple to use We connected to our tv and set it on a shelf behind our couch so my husband can hear without blaring out the rest of the house Had one for years Bought a second one for linking in stereo LOVE IT Update after a month of useI like this unit more than I did initially While it s not as powerful as some of its competitors it does shine in several categories This unit really excels in smaller spaces It really does well when it s placed in a corner It s 360 degree sound profile uses the walls to bounce and project sound using the corner walls as a pseudo speaker cabinet Sound is much richer used this way Portability is also a key ingredient Size and form factor plat a big part The killer feature is the handle I know that sounds dumb but it is really really useful The lithium ion battery is also a monster Took this to the beach boating and back to a bbq and only used 25 of the battery life after a full day of activity The Bose Connect app is what everyone else should aspire to No gimmicky features Start it up connect to your paired device and then stream whatever audio you want from any app The unit supports multiple people connecting to it simultaneously via Bose Connect so no more wait while I un pair so a friend can play the next song I ve also found this is a great audio pairing option for laptop and desktop audio Much better sound quality than stock speakers wireless Bluetooth freedom Our old 27 iMac is in the guest bedroom and we paired this to create a simple audio video system that works quite well for when guests visit I also use the device occasionally when we golf When I tested it out at the beach sound quality was average to good and loudness was enough that we found ourselves constantly turning it down so as to not offend people nearby Previous review points below still apply Probably would boost it a star if it were cheaper 300 tax is a big bite for a device of this size I will keep the unit I did decide to keep the unit but mostly just because I can afford to do so Purchased this unit based upon a ton of positive reviews Bose clearly took a page out of the Apple design playbook Very well designed The handle is a simple yet awesome feature The unit is a lot smaller than the pictures depicts Top quality packaging and simple setup make using this a breeze Requires the Bose Connect app from the App Store The device is primarily intended to be paired to a mobile device or tablet Skip the Bose opt in as if we need yet another account and more emails kthx Here s the rub While this is an interesting Bluetooth device it s a VERY expensive device By comparison I paid about 50 more for a HEOS 5 that blows this out of the water in terms of sound quality While the HEOS isn t portable the bar is pretty high Overall sound quality is ok not amazing Lots of mid range and treble Bass is present but it s not very pronounced Acceptable but not great Overall volume output is good but it s not sensational You re not going to throw any keggers or raves I suspect a small to medium sized group of people wouldn t enjoy this very much if they were super talkative of having a lot of fun I think for lounging on the deck it would be fine I question whether this unit would be very good for outdoor use It just doesn t have the oomf power to produce enough volume and I suspect sound quality would be a lot less also It s definitely not a home stereo replacement Overall 3 stars Good not great If it was 150 it would get another star For the money involved you should be able to get some kick equipment This unit is decent but severely overpriced You re paying for the Bose name and a big lithium battery My daughter s Bose Soundlink color puts out almost as much wattage and better Bass at 1 3 the cost I don t think that I can justify keeping this unit for what it cost ProsGreat form factorHandle Easy setupSuper long batteryGood soundApp connectConsPriceSound quality could be a lot betterVolume limited easy to cap outNo sound shaping controls This product has a clear sound with great bass Purchased this for Christmas for my wife she was totally surprised because she wanted this so bad It sounds awesome and works flawlessly Recommend it to anyone thinking about buying it Looking for substantial sound heartfelt music to bringback your feelings for oan old song or childhood memories To let you test your deep ranges right up to your high notes this speaker paired with your fav muisic or pandora chanels can GET you singing again Even singing privately as most of us 50s 60s folks preferl Bose model can produce crystal highs deep dramatic base and perfect midrange where most of us sing anyway Boy have I been looking if you have too let me SAVE you all that time which you can put toward enjoying how your heart feels high simply on muisic I saved for this it IS an investmentf yet it s a handsome piece and with your music you may end up like me smiling singing laughing Truly a wonderful compact piece that even hangs Make the investment smiles and singing is priceless Great product easy to use Great bathroom accessory Bose products never fails Tho pricey its worth every penny Bass is superb Sleek appearance and ease of use Very handy Almost returned after unboxing bass was nonexistent and the Bose Connect app doesn t have equalizer settings Was able to do a workaround through the equalizer in my Spotify app where I play most music from but disappointed you can t adjust bass at a minimum on the unit Between that and charging cradle as separate purchase I took off a star That said with the workaround it sounds great Just be aware you ll have to make those adjustments from the music source not the speaker itself Great Product SoundWhen your playing BoseThey listen like it s E F Hutton This is a solid speaker but it s weirdly using the now almost a decade out of date micro usb port to charge instead of USB C It s a decent speaker but that s an annoying thing that will surprise a lot of buyers I bought a boss black speaker a week ago and I like it but the price go up from 205 to 299 I now for white color I think is not fair as a customer The only mark i dont like is the pronounciation of the voice assitant I use this every day and every night also travel with it I m a dance instructor and need a loud speaker for big rooms This has been perfect Good speaker until the charger plug stops working We enjoyed it for three years Plan for no more than that life But disappointing Product was great I m a big fan of bose but their products aren t cheap I heard this speaker at a restaurant and waited for a sale It really fills the space with clear clean sound The battery life is fantastic It replaces an old Ultimate Ears speaker that no longer turns off after a firmware update It s not a bug That was a desired feature The battery dies so quickly with it This is fantastic Very worth the money Home had to be rebuilt from storm so I got to rebuild to my specifications I m blown away with how the speaker synced easily to my Bose 700soundbar in my Great room The 360 sounds sits in the middle of room tying in the soundbar surround sound speakers together I enjoying amazing sounds in this large room hearing even more sounds coming from the field of the game players talking Take it out to the Fl room have surround sound there as well The sound link speaker can be taken anywhere so I m definitely buying another sound link speaker use this for my outdoor adventures looking at sound link options for my next purchase This 360 speaker is synced with both soundbar s I have the Bose 500 Soundbar in my bedroom rocking my home The sound link just makes your Bose surround sounds systems even better Never dreamed of tv music coming from same system love todays technology Music Sports Movies sounds are the best coming from Bose systems my home rocks My old SoundLink which I had for many years and loved it got rained on and stopped working so I got this as a replacement Sound is what you would expect from Bose Huge sound from a small package Replaced my old Bose SoundLink 1 with this and this is even a better choice Definitely fills up the room with crystal clear sound if you are playing a great recording Was disappointed with the Bose QCII earbuds but this really makes up for that disappointment Highly recommend Why are you still using the old USB CHARGER Great product great sound but Bose is using old USB technology Frustrating Perhaps to make us buy the wireless charger I bought this for my husband s birthday This is his second one The first one lasted over 10 years traveling with us and providing us with music inside and outside The sound is amazing from this small speaker battery life is decent sound quality is great This speaker provides a sharp clean crisp sound unlike any other At first I admit I thought this was overpriced But I gave it a try because Bose is a well respected brand and although I had read some not so positive reviews I could experience it at work I decided to go for it and I really think it was a great desicion Sound is amazing it just sounds so well I admit I am no specialist in sound or anything but I ve tried some speakers of mine and friends of mine This one hasn t been beaten The size is right one can take it anywhere and the 360 feature is just amazing It isn t cheap it isn t smart either that s for sure but you get the quality you pay for and I was looking for neat sound quality and I got even better than neat Best device with exceptional in room sound and much appreciated battery charge life Bluetooth user friendliness is also much appreciated These are much better that my JVC Charge 4 speakers They don t lose connection as easily and sound much better The media could not be loaded I was not satisfied with the product for three reasons First the material of the Bose speaker is prone to leaving fingerprints which I find unappealing Second the wall charger that came with the speaker makes a high pitched noise when it is charging the device which disturbs my sleep I wonder if I received a defective unit I have attached a video to demonstrate the noise issue And it is pricey than quality sound This is my second unit bought this year Why Simple they sound great A single speaker sounds really good It does a great job of creating stereo sound but I wanted the real thing With a second speaker using the Bose app you can put them in Party Mode This spreads the sound out wonderfully but when you slide the stereo button on wow This is how music was meant to be listened to It s a bit pricey but I waited for them to go on sale 100 off each time But after hearing them I would not have an issue paying the full price it Amazing speaker good quality Like the sound and easy to use Love Love Love Boise you re the BEST The sound quality is fantastic and the bass is the best I ve heard out of a small speaker like this The battery life seems adequate but I haven t really used it too much when it s not plugged in The only issue I have and it s incredibly annoying is that it takes about 10 attempts at turning the speaker off and then trying to restart my music app on my phone to get the volume to reset The volume is stuck on a really low setting now matter how much I may try to turn it up when I first try connecting I have no idea how to fix this If anyone knows how to fix this please let me know If it weren t for this I d give this 5 stars Bose has top quality sound I have friends who are in the music industry and they will vouch for Bose Sennheiser and Audiotechnica any day I have played around with the sound link revolve and I ve been waiting to buy one for myself Luckily Black Friday got me a sweet discount The sound is crisp and clear You will enjoy listening to music on this The only negative point I have is the use on usb A port for charging It would be wonderful to have a universal usb C port As compensation for that they do provide a cable and charger I am hard of hearing due to inoperable vestibular damage in both ears No hearing aids either Music means everything to me and I couldn t listen to it and hear everything Problem is solved now I can hear instruments I hadn t heard and vocalists are no longer muffled I am so happy with this purchase I keep it on a table beside me with it paired to my Alexa Echo Dot 3rd Generation I tell Alexa what to play and this Bose makes it come alive for me With all research I did this won in my decision making process I purchased one of these speakers 17 months ago I ve used it more than I ever imagined I would and finally decided to purchase the second speaker so I could enjoy stereo It is great with all the music moved from my IPOD to mymusic com I ve also downloaded a music app which allows me to choose from hundreds of stations of all kinds and that has exponentially increased my usage of my two speakers which I can move anywhere in the house at will Fantastic product This is a upgrade from the bluetooth bose from a few years ago Perfect for our job sites construstion or to better hear the bass We are muscians and like to record and play back to listen to our instrustments Nice to hear the bass We enjoy it Battery Life would love a better battery life on all our stuff but we can charge and play so thats nice we are pleased with it I wanted a visually pleasing portable speaker with smooth bass and decent tone at a reasonable price for my office and anywhere else it might come in handy This speaker fit the bill perfectly especially while on sale I would like a bit more crispness but for the price size and super simple ease of set up and use this is a little powerhouse I ve had lots of positive comments about it And the battery life is amazing so far I can play it through a 10 hour shift and it will still say it is 90 100 charged I love it and I m thinking about getting a second Definitely recommend Bought 2 of these after reading you could pair them for party mode and or stereo I had no interest in a single speaker I already had an altec lansing for that though the sound is inferior to these Unfortuntely the first thing I tried to do was use the Bose Connect App I down loaded before i even got the speakers Followed the intuitive instructions and had no problem pairing with each speaker seperately but to pair two speakers either for party mode or stereo you have to be in party mode to intiate stereo you HAVE to use the Bose Connect App to go into party mode stereo It s been 2 weeks and used at least different devices and I have only managed to get into party mode twice SO THATS A HUGE FAIL considering the price I paid to be able to pair two speakers It s also a HUGE FAIL on the lack of fast charging in 2023 24 The sound on these are good for the size but if they are lacking the most it s bass so a seperate subwoofer option would be a nice addition IF YOU COULD BUILD EQUIPMENT THAT COULD ACTUALLY PAIR WITH OTHER UNITS WITHOUT FAULTY SOFTWARE TO CONTROL IT FIRST Disappointed in Bose I have owned a lot of Bose products over the years and through out most of them Bose stood head and shoulders over most competitors with well built well crafted industry standard products but it s always disappointing when a well trusted brand sells you an inferior product whether it s material workmanship design or software or all of the above It sucks when you have 2 of the exact same speakers but you can only listen to one at a time and the only option you have is to struggle to get the manufacturers app to actually do what it s supposed to be created for DON T BUY THIS SPEAKER OR ANY OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS IN THIS SERIES THAT RELY ON THE BOSE CONNECT APP IF YOU WANT TO PAIR SPEAKERS IT S NOT WORTH IT THESE WERE NOT A CHEAP MISTAKE I m difficult to impress but I m giving credit where credit is due These Bose are definitely as clear as they re known to be and easy to use These 2nd gen have a much better battery life than 1st gen I originally ordered 1 unit and then later that day ordered a second one DEFINITELY get at least 2 The sound quality with 2 is what I expected from a high quality product like Bose They are very lightweight portable easy to use and can pair multiple speakers via Bluetooth for full surround sound Seriously Download the Bose Revolve II Soundlink App to control them It does the thinking for you by guiding you through the pairing and steps controlling the units Easy peezy I purchased the cases and flat cradle chargers too Highly recommend all I personally like a touch more bass in my music but these things only weigh about as much as my cell phone for Pete s Sake so this was completely expected as the rule of thumb is more bass more weight and I wasn t about to order portable speakers that had a little more bass and were going to tire me from just carrying them around everywhere No thanks to that idea Heh Product approved Very happy with my purchases and thanks to seller The media could not be loaded Nice sound very loud and perfect size The Bose app is useless wish it had EQ controls and the Micro USB charging port kind of bugs me as well But other than that it s very nice Love the sound seems like Bose products were better before as far as the sound quality the first identical item i purchased broke when it fell and so i purchased this replacement but it does not sound as crisp as the previous one Its not a good speaker at full volume and you need a decent space for acoustics to get the best sound out of it I think maybe i was expecting more for the price If you want something small and compact that has a decent sound to it this is for you Right out of the box it sounds great at low to mid volume but after that it kind of gets distorted You can turn the bass down on your phone and it wont do that but kind of defeated the purpose of why i wanted a bose speaker in the first place if thats what i gotta do then should ve just went with JBL or some other brand Honestly for the price i think there are better options depending on your sound preferences I like loud with bass and clarity a hard combination to get right yes i know but thats my preference The bose color speaker i had didn t have that problem so i had expected more I am really enjoying this speaker It follows me throughout the house My main concern that keeps it from being 5 is that the bose app doesn t recognize it I like how small and portable it is and I m using it for a Audio Technica Turntable I love this speaker It is very easy to connect and the sound quality is great The battery life is amazing I highly recommend this portable speaker Bose what else can you say haha Great clear quality I got this as a gift for my daughter Gave to her early haha She like so much better than her smaller Bose The smaller one is great product but speaker only in front The 360 is so nice I like because can join another one on I wish I had one but kids come first haha My cousin came to my home with this speaker and I instantly knew I wanted it And so here I am reporting on the speaker that I purchased after already sampling it and yup I still love it It s small easy to move around insanely loud and the best part is that it can be controlled with an app Almost anything with Bluetooth connects to it your phone your laptop tablet etc so you can stream whatever your favorite streaming service is right to it If you have more than one Bose speaker then you can set up something called party mode and have these or other Bose speakers set up around your house I didn t need to though I used this for a get together and the music was blaring and could be heard throughout my entire house This was so worth the purchase especially for someone like me who does not have ample space for a huge sound system and doesn t want to add surround sound in my house It works just like it says it does Nice sound Quality expensive Bose you get what you pay for Bought two one for me and one for my daughter She teaches and uses it daily in her classroom for educational and playtime purposes Fills any room with sound comparable to a much larger system Pair two speakers together and you won t believe your ears In love with this cornet it sounds very good and is very resistant This speaker is fantastic I wanted something that filled the room and then some and this speaker fit the bill I love the quality of the sound Bose speakers have always been great for me OMG I am so glad I bought this We bought it to play music during our church service It is so easy to connect to a cell phone via bluetooth The loudness fills a room and has that nice BOSE base to it I love this little fella We got it in black to be hidden away from view I know it s not a huge thing but I love the fact it as a handle on it Makes it much easier to carry to avoid dropping The batter lasts a good while and a charging cable comes with it You also can walk pretty far from it and it is still connected I had my phone in my bedroom and took the speaker outside in the garage while washing the car No interruptions in connection I highly recommend I haven t tried it on a camera tripod yet but will soon Like the sound but drops blue tooth items if there s been no connection for a while If only there was a way to connect to a PC or app on your phone to adjust the time limit Other wise so far so good This speaker is my favorite I take it everywhere i can I love the way it sounds especially the bass I love how easy it is to connect from my phone or tablet even my computer When im at home i often use these over my edifier bookshelf speakers just to play music all over my house I recently brought these speakers to the beach and i can hear and feel my music so clearly and it wasnt so obnoxious that it was bothering the other visitors It stayed clean and it s been beaten up quite a bit too Other people have accidentally dropped them from 5 6ft and it s still working perfectly with very minor scratches Im thinking of buying another one just so i can use Party Mode on the app Great sound probably worth the money I bought it in part because I believed that the SimpleSync connectivity would enable it to pair up with my Soundbar 300 system The list of compatible devices for this to work included Smart Soundbar 300 so I thought it was good to go Nope My Soundbar 300 isn t actually Smart it turns out You need the Smart Soundbar 300 which happens to be a completely different and newer system The Soundlink Revolve cannot pair with either of my existing Sountouch speakers They were purchased in 2018 I bought myself one and my dad loved it I got him one too So far they have not been used that much and have not had them all that long but I can tell you nothing sounds better So far the battery has been better than okay I am just a little confused on it I am wondering if the battery holds up to what it says I am not saying that it is horrible just questionable I need to pay better attention to this and hopefully I can come back and update Other than that splurge Other products seem to hold no comparison to these excellent sound for such a small speaker the bluetooth connection was very easy to set up for me I am low tech in my skills This is a nice speaker sounds good but compared to my mini sound link bar it s no match I think sound quality in mini sound link is next best to the wave Unfortunately the wave is not made Bluetooth compatible yet I do not need it to be portable 360 sound it s backed to a wall nor do I need it to be waterproof I primarily use this speaker when I m working out I like to get lost in my music It does turn up nicely but wish it had a little bit more depth to it soundAs for the battery so far it s fantastic if you re looking for a long life battery this is the speaker It s been charged once since I bought it 5 weeks ish as of today it still has 40 battery I use it roughly 45 60 minutes 5 6 days a week Speaker I was replacing only lasted 40 minutes while plugged into a wall Great speaker Easily the biggest sounding portable speaker ever Loved the sound Only problem is the battery life does drain much quicker Great little house speaker gives music nice depth Great sound solid design and ergonomically top tier Fantastic product all round I was in need of a new versatile portable speaker to fit my summer adventures one that was portable enough to fit in a beach bag and left in my car or to play out in my pool area that packed a punch in sound After a week of owning this speaker all in all it has checked every box TLDR This speaker while a tiny bit smaller than what I was expecting packs amazing sound quality from a trusted brand to easily liven up any outdoor occasion Their app is great for EQ settings however the physical ULT button provided great boost to your music by itself to hype up any outdoor event Waterproofing is great and holds a good charge while being extremely portable with its carrying strap Packaging The speaker arrived in a regular cardboard box While it was nice to see Sony turn to the newer trend of making packaging as recyclable as possible I did notice that the pieces holding the speaker were flimsy and could possibly be a concern during delivery However mine thankfully arrived in perfect condition Included inside the box was the speaker itself with the carrying band already attached a USB A to USB C charging cable and a very small paper pamphlet Instructions for the speaker are found through a scanned QR code within this pamphlet which allowed for more information about the speaker to be addressed Sound Quality As to no surprise from this being from Sony this speaker sounds amazing It doesn t get tinny at higher volumes the dual drivers create amazing bass and overall it covers all genres with no issue presenting truly enjoyable melodies for all music At max volume while the speaker does not get deafening loud if you are outdoors indoors it possibly will depending on what you define as deafening lol it certain gets loud enough to entertain a large area In my 40 foot by 120 foot patio this speaker shined and was the center piece of great sound quality and entertainment While it certain suits my needs for loudness you can always take it a notch up by either using the ULT button or pairing it with a second ULT Field 1 and working them in stereo both discussed in features Features This speaker is packed with all of the expected features of a modern Bluetooth speaker It quickly connects to remembered devices when powered on one nice little note to power on off this device only a single press of the power button is needed for each While a small detail it truly is something that is appreciated for ease of use and has a great battery life While I cannot speak for the full I ve gone 6 hours of using the speaker which left it at 50 so I believe their claim of 12 hours of battery life to be true This speaker also has a quick charger feature of 10 mins of charging for 3 hours of playback I haven t tested that myself as of yet but I have other newer Song products with similar fast charging features and their claims for those products have not fallen short so I believe these ones as well There is also a Bluetooth pairing button a multiple use button that can play pause tracks skip reverse tracks and answer hang up phone calls depending on need Functionality was clearly a forethought of this speaker since this button s commands while certainly vast are greatly designed Play pause is a single press skip is a double press reverse is a triple press and it converts to a call answer hang up button with a single press functionality when you receive a call There are also independent volume up down buttons which increase the volume by a decent percentage in each press Then there is the ULT button which is a built in EQ adjustment presented as a physical button on the speaker It comes with default settings when pressed that noticeably enhance the all around sound quality of any melody with an emphasis on bass and treble The EQ for the ULT button can be adjusted in the Sony Music Center app It s a great feature to use when you want to give that extra boost to your music While I have not tried it myself this speaker also has the ability to be set in stereo with a second ULT speaker and I m sure the dual speaker combination could easily work as a stereo set up for any venue needs The waterproofing of this speaker is on par with expectations I ve taken it to many water based areas and have gotten it splashed with water and it s been completely fine The USB C charging port is covered with a water tight seal that you can open and close easily This speaker works with Sony s music center app and while it s a bit rougher than their headphone app it still works wonderfully to optimize the speaker s functionality and performance Full EQ settings are available along with specific battery percentage updates and settings for the speaker The included carrying strap is a nice touch that I will admit I did not initially think I was going to like however it very quickly grew on me and I find myself carrying the speaker solely by the strap anywhere I take it It is tied onto the speaker and can be removed however you will have to re tie it yourself if you want to reattach it Build Quality Once again as expected from this price point and the Song brand this is truly a high quality speaker It feels great to hold with the fabric being sturdy and made of soft material The buttons are covered in strong rubber that give a satisfying response when pushed The carrying strap is thick and made of a high quality and very slightly elastic material You are certainly getting your money s worth on quality alone which is what I expect from the Song brand Final Thoughts While it is certainly understandable to hesitant when looking at a 120 Bluetooth speaker this one truly is worth its value I have very little complaints with this speaker and think that it s a great edition to anyone s outdoor entertainment experience The ULT button is a feature I find myself using more than expected in a good way to help boost my music during gatherings to help the entertainment With its waterproofing I feel comfortable using it as a travel speaker to any destination I plan on visiting This feature packed speaker is truly one of a kind and I m certainly satisfied with my purchase Color is as pictured So pretty and vibrant Charge stays charged Deep clean and shower lasted all daySound quality clear Good for what I use it for Just loud enough Bass is not hitting hard like I would like Easy to connect Easy to carry Fits in bathroom counter easily which is important for my shower concerts lol The media could not be loaded So yes 5 stars and I mean that To cut to the chase this is an excellent speaker and you should get one Now I usually do not post reviews but I thought if you knew all this it would help you understand why I gave it 5 stars and recommend it so highly SOUNDIt sounds way bigger than it looks The ULT button adds a lot of bass and I love that It is great for EDM Hip hop R B 80s 90s I tried basically everything I could and it all sounded great Even added a little more depth to a classical cello playlist I listen to while I am working If you like a less bass heavy sound just turn the ULT feature off and it will sound excellent If that does not suit you there is a 3 band EQ in the app OH and it sounds just as good standing up as it does lying down APPAs mentioned there is an EQ in there You can also change other settings and even see the battery life which I could not believe was still 60 after a couple of days of me casually using it Super surprised because I never charged it when I got it Oh I also noticed the group with other speakers and apparently you can pair another one of these and get stereo sound out of them I have not tried that but I will as soon as I get my second one STRAPThis was one I was really unsure about when looking at it online The strap is genius It can tighten or loosen and then stay in place My little one liked to carry it around like a purse but it is really versatile and I found I could hang it one way or another everywhere I went DESIGNAgain the design is great it is very stable standing up or lying down The buttons are easy to use and because they are raised you can use them without even looking at them The SONY logo on the front looks silver most of the time but actually has some I don t know what but it changes color which is a nice touch See pics Love the Forest Grey color it is exactly as expected A subtle green grey that I have gotten a lot more comments on than I ever though I would LIFE KID PROOF Ok so I like music in the shower and let me tell you this thing delivers even when it got wet it still sounded clear I did not need to have it at full volume either Of course my girls heard it and when it was bath time they wanted to have it with them That is when I discovered it could float Now it does not sound great that way but it still played even after multiple accidental dunks in the tub They also loved to see what they could put on the woofer part and see it dance and fall out Lastly it is stink proof as well as mud sand and waterproof My daughters and I clean the pond behind our house usually after big storms and pick up plastic and other garbage we find My 6 yo who likes to hold the speaker as a purse thought it would be a great idea to bring Ultra that is what they named it with us while we did so As expected it dropped into the stinky pond muck when a dragonfly landed on it and she screamed and tossed it like a live grenade after fishing it out I rinsed it off with some dawn and the water hose and it was good as new To say this has held up remarkably well is an understatement It looks great sounds great and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a portable speaker Hope this review helps This little speaker surprised me This ULT button packs a punch but not in the way you would think Most of my past speakers with a boost button basically increased bass It s fine if that s all you want but the equalization isn t there The bass over powers the voice or the other instruments This ULT button gives you more bass check and the other sounds also get enhanced It s pretty remarkable The strap is cool I can hang it from the table umbrella in my back yard Porting the side speakers was smart You can use it horizontal like normal or when you stand it vertically the bottom speaker isn t fully covered The air can go somewhere I think Sony has a winner here This is definitely coming pool side and beach side on our next trip to FLA I got the white color Looks good I m glad I picked this one It s definitely a keeper Oh all the other good stuff Easy to connect to iPhone 12 hour battery is very good for me and small for its power Also works as a speaker phone and all the proofs Beach proof and clumsy me proof Not a Bose flex link But good for the price ULT setting is a bit muffled Base is good Voice highs are a little low in the ULT settling Updated itself upon starting program Does include an equalizer program Not a stereo unit After trying out Sony Wireless Speaker I have to say my family and I were impressed My teenage son has always been a hard sell on design He was sold The shiny Sony logo caught his attention immediately I was surprise on the sound quality This is me speaking from comparing to a different Sony speaker I ve owned in the past xb23 is the model number I think The cool factors for me were 1 push the ULT button to enhance the bass and clear highs that really bring out the music while hanging out in the backyard 2 Strap It allows me to hang the speaker on the patio umbrella and out of the way of things see pic 3 Setting it up was a breeze Wifey opened up the box push the power button paired the bluetooth all on her own Lastly what really stood out to me was how well built this speaker is It feels sturdy and durable but it s lightweight enough to take with me wherever I go Plus the sleek design looks great Haven t had it long enough to noticed any cons about this speaker If I were to say something I d say price I purchased the speaker at regular price because I needed a second unit for our backyard I d like to wait for the first sale to purchase 1 or 2 more for my family members with Mother s Day and Graduation around the corner The ULT field 1 is an incredible compact speaker My Go to was always the JBL flip series as i right now own the flip 6 Design The utility here is great it has a carry strap that doubles as a hanger or a handle the build is very rugged and high quality i would not baby this thing at all it handles its own Sound Performance Out of the box the speaker comes with ULT on and WOAH it gets very loud for its size This speaker connects to sony s music center app where you can customize the eq connect in stereo to another field 1 and many other settings The sound is very open clear on vocals it fills up a big room really well and maps the sound out A really great sounding speaker Battery life is really good it varies how you use it but real world use 50 80 volume ULT on its good for 8 10 hours straight It does take a while to charge about 5 hours if its completely drained But thats good for the overall life of the battery Compared to JBL flip 6 Ive been back forth between these two for the past couple days And i found myself reaching for the field 1 It sounds better its more open it sounds like the music fills up any room as for the JBL it targets the sound directly at you and the highs are a bit harsh sony simply just outperforms it Value at retail 128 I would buy this speaker no question Its great and performs as well as speakers above its weight class On sale 98 i would buy it IMMEDIATELY insane value This is a nice sounding wireless speaker My issue is that it only turns up a little with my phone and tablet If I m listening to a talk and the person has a quiet voice I can t hear clearly Even with the device turned all the way up and the speaker itself turned all the way up Music sounds great from this speaker I do like the cord the speaker has on top so it can be hung I don t think it was worth the price I paid for it Maybe 50 but 99 I would expect better So far the battery life has been excellent and it was easy to set up the Bluetooth The size is perfect as well It also works great recieving and answering calls If you re on the fence get this I was looking for a new speaker to replace my old UE Boom that had a static tick in it love UE but every speaker I ve had goes this route eventually This new portable Sony speaker didn t have the thousands of reviews that more expensive or cheaper and well known but risker speakers had However every review was positive and they were right so far Though I ve only had this about a month it s been a massive improvement in my home and away music setup The sound is gorgeous The bass is clear and deep I m sure audiophiles can find a 1000 speaker that will be tuned to perfection but for music fans without those funds and who need a trusty travel speaker this is the one The forest green grey looks cool and shows off how well made it is Only potential con so far is that it takes a while to shut off by itself I don t have the Sony app so maybe this is a setting you can change It s by no means a problem unless you are banking on it shutting itself off The connection lasts even if your music app closes which is nice The rope handle also makes it so you can t just slam it down it has to be the right orientation It s tied loosely though so you could untie it for more position flexibility you d just have a longer string to carry it I am very particular and this speaker checked all my boxes 10 10 recommend What I was looking for was a compact bluetooth speaker that packs a punch in bass so I decided to give this Sony speaker a try and boy was I surprised by it 1 Bluetooth pairing First pairing this was super easy I happen to have an Android phone and once bluetooth is on it automatically pops up on my phone and asks if I want to pair it 2 Design for a compact size speaker it is really lightweight and because the speaker is shaped the way it is it can easily stand up by itself or laid out sideways The tether that comes with it can easily be strapped on to my backpack or a bicycle 3 Bass The sound varies depending on the position of the speaker but the bass is surprisingly good The secret here is the ult button Once you press that it really amps up the bass while not sacrificing the clarity of the vocals What I thought was cool was the companion app that you can use to control the speaker in which you can also customize the sound through the equalizer I am not too picky when it comes to sound but the opportunity to customize it will be super flexible for those who like their own sound 4 Sound Quality and Distance This to me was the main reason why I am giving it 5 stars The sound quality has really good range from the low tones to the high tones I like to listen to the variety of different styles of music and I am very impressed of the sound reproduction of this speaker Usually I am not too far away from the speaker but there had been times where I had to go downstairs to do something and what s nice is that the speaker had really good range for a bluetooth speaker The sound never cut out once As a bonus what I discovered in the app was an option to either turn on sound quality performance or focus on a stable connection and I think that will allow some people to really enjoy their music even from a far away distance 5 Price 128 is still a lot of money but for this amount of money and what I am getting from this speaker I say it is well worth it because I can take this literally anywhere outside or inside There have been a couple of times when my phone was paired to the speaker and somebody called in and I had a conversation with them not knowing I can actually talk to them from the speaker So yes if you can afford this speaker I say give this a try You won t be disappointed After 10 years of getting tossed around and used in the rain or humid environments I had to retire my trusty Bose mini sound link 2 I have been looking for a replacement for some time but found most options lacking especially in matching the Bose s bass However from the first listen these blew me away They sound clean can get very loud amazing battery life but most of all they have unbelievably great bass from such a small package It s a bit bigger than the Bose but is actually lighter and overall build quality is excellent with some nice details The ULT mode is awesome and the connection is strong even through walls or far away when outside I love the orange but I am mindful that it is a cloth cover with semi exposed tweeters on the ends so I d recommend a case or something if taking it to dirty environments or in a bag mixed with sharp things The rubber on both sides does leave me comfortable that if this falls it won t be any issue plus it works well for placing vertically in tight spaces Overall can highly recommend and would say it s no comparison to the UE boom Bose sound link flex or Beats Pill I had previously tried I ordered this from South Africa and it took a week to get to me so Im blown away by that firstly Secondly the speaker is THE best looking mini speaker So functional the rope strappy thing is amazing I honestly thing this is better compared to the JBL charge not the JBL flip I think Sony just dropped JBL The part that sucks is that you gotta get another Field 1 for stereo while JBL can partner up with any other JBL You can use the custom EQ to get the Sound louder and clearer or atleast to you liking The way I use it is ULT mode off for podcasts ULT on for normal music at low volumes and custom on for party mode with MAX bass if you know how to place this speaker in the room like higher up you get pure bliss Love it Wow Sony What a magnificent comeback This is the best sounding speaker I ve encountered at this size and price The hourglass shape is great for palming it Initially I didn t think I d like the strap but I love how tight it is making it a perfect handle The speaker can seamlessly stand or sit facing you or directly up to disperse the sound evenly Doing a Hz test next to one of my Charge 5 s it easily competes I did these tests on my mattress to better feel the vibration of each unit The Sony produced noticeably more vibration than the Charge 5 which blew my mind Supposedly designed to compete with the Flip 6 it s in my opinion better than my Charge 5 Whatever Sony s engineers are doing they hit a home run The clarity is wild the bass response is wild and the ULT button sounds like it s unleashing the Iron Giant and I m here for that Most speakers don t appear on my connected devices widget but this one does After listening for the last 4 hours at about 50 volume with ULT turned on I only lost 20 of the battery Bluetooth connection is swift taking about 3 seconds from pressing the power button to streaming audio from your connected device I purchased the orange ULT Field 1 Normally I go for neutral colors like white gray or black but this orange really pops and looks sweet It comes with a short 12 Sony branded USB A to USB C charging cable Sony you should hook us up with 3 foot cables Sony has truly outdone themselves with the ULT Field 1 The combination of design performance and features makes it a standout speaker in its category Highly recommended First off I have 4 college age children so over the years we have gone through our share of portable speakers So when Sony announced their new lineup and after reading a couple of early reviews I decided to take a chance on the new ULT1 As for the looks this Gator orange color is great It stands out and it s exactly what I was looking for and when turning it on the first time it immediately notified my phone which made pairing simple The design is perfect with the handle in the right spot and when I did my can it float test it righted itself every time and didn t loose a beat As for that handle at first it comes off a bit odd but once you realize it s dual purpose it s fairly cool In terms of size it s about as good as it gets as it s small enough to fit in a cup holder but big enough to feel substantial Now for what counts The sound quality is fantastic As many other speakers in the same class I was expecting moderate performance but the sound was crisp but not tin canish and the bass was great for a speaker this size Out of the box it has the ULT boost on but you can shut it off with a touch of a button From a durability standpoint the edges seem stout and could probably handle the inevitable drops to come Finally as for the battery it lasted all afternoon on Mother s Day in the unforgiving Florida heat and humidity so I d say it will do it s job on a beach day as well All in all I m very happy with the ULT1 and I m looking forward to the enjoyment it will bring my family Structure of the speaker is solid well built Great sound considering it s a lower level Sony speaker I also own the 250 one but the difference is fairly negligible The bass boost isn t much Seems like it s just an EQ adjustment But depending on the song it can be pretty cool I have the Sony SRS XB23 EXTRA BASS and I was expecting to get a big improvement Difference is hardly noticeable Probably the Ult field 1 is 5 10 better but not a huge improvement If you don t own a portable speaker comparable to the SRS XB23 by all means get this good clear sound great bass fills a small to medium room size When on sale 95 usd this is a great value too The media could not be loaded Yo Sony did amazing with this I was looking for days for a new speaker because my other one got jacked I had the Bose sound link mini which also is a great speaker but compared to the new model or this Sony xlt model I was torn 1 I know how Bose is so I was like damn but I was looking into Sony and only because I was thinking of getting a tv and ppl who had Sony talked highly There are so many Sony speakers and different price points This speaker sounded like you had a subwoofer and connected speakers at a party that s how the quality was in this mini speaker It s water proof the strap was better than expected I didn t care for it but now I can attach to my surroundings environment it s like an extra nice touch The app you download is not needed to play or connect it s just nice if u have multiple speakers to connect gives you battery info etc the charging is usb C and it fast charging I just got this speaker and I m writing a review this shows how excited and amazed I am still ha The Price for the speaker well it s definitely worth it 1 u can buy two for under 300 vers 1 speaker for that price and have surround sound The to speakers that come in this one price is worth it buy it if you are thinking about it No jack cable I don t have anything that needs it so I m good haha You can also play it sideways and it has some holes so it can work with out disrupting sound quality Product came in nicely packaged Upon opening box it gives clear instructions to setup speaker The quality of sound without using the ult button is decent Once it is on it a whole new ball park Used it for the first time at a family birthday party and everyone was impressed with its sound and build quality Went in to a local store and compared to JBL and Bose and Sony blew them away Sony ULT 1 is awesome and I ll explain why Bass is still extremely strong but does not drown out the highs and for the first time I hear a mid range The sound is just so much better compared to JBL JBL has always sounded hollow to me like I was missing half the sound Now I realize it s just a small speaker but Sony made me realize I have been missing something If you want great sound quality Sony does it best The design is killer I currently have it on my island in the kitchen and it s super easy to connect with my iPhone Most of all no light show pretty straight forward which I like when I go camping and the beach I m definitely going to get the bigger version ULT7 for the pool but wanted to test this one first Great job Sony This may be too much information but seeing as how I m of the hearing aid generation I got this to enable me to listen to stuff while I m in the shower I needed a speaker which could get a little wet This little Sony speaker is just right It s small but has big sound If it gets a little splashed no problem Perhaps I should point out that I can t wear hearing aids in the shower So this solved my problem But more than that it s just a good sounding speaker and is well made It quickly pairs via Bluetooth My son was very excited and pleased with the product He uses it in his room daily and in the shower I have not taken ot outside yet but it s better than most all my audio but stuff turned my chromebook in to a mini theater Get 2 and you have portable stereo surround sound I think I might do that It s a great speaker for the price bang for the buck better than any other I ve seen Should get to the beach or whatever you re going I love this speaker Sony never disappoints when it comes to audio I only take the 0 5 star because of a tiny little bit less clarity than I would like I m peaky with my audio speakers but is the best in its price range speakers I owned an old SRS X55 which resembled a black brick but had great sound It finally became a brick and needed to be replaced This latest Bluetooth speaker ULT 1 is fantastic It has a 3 band eq not great but very functional using an app on my phone The volume control works better than the control on my mini iPad it s paired with It s smaller but the sound is every bit as good as the larger brick it replaced Five stars The bass on this speaker is amazingggg I m picky when it comes to speakers cause u love EDM and most speakers don t do the sound justice This one though did not disappoint at all Sound is amazing ult option is great to have and makes a huge difference when it s on Battery life is great design is super cute and functional and it connects super quick and easy Definitely worth it Great quality and sound Great quality amazing sound and great volume Not an audiophile but the sound quality was definitely great It does seems however that the ULT button is required to be on in order for the best sound to be produced Without it the sound quality degrades noticeably I just got the device so no comments on battery life Price is fine I guess but I recommend getting this device when on sale Update New con to this speaker is that it does not have a previous track or next track button built in It s honestly a nitpick but noticeable The quality is very good Music came alive This is how all my music collections should sounds like I have six more Bluetooth speakers in the house This SONY beats ALL of them BOSE soundlink revolve 2 plus BOSE minilink JBL Charge5 and Flip6 Harman Kardon studio 7 comes close Boom Im happy Great sound easy to set up great price for the quality I am very impressed with this speaker It was time to replace my old JBL and I decided to go with this speaker because of the design size and color I took the speaker on an overnight camping trip The battery life was super impressive and the Bluetooth connection surprised me It stayed connected despite me repeatedly forgetting that my phone was in my pocket and I would wonder away from the speaker The sound was very impressive It was very clear and has plenty of bass Being outdoors we turned it up pretty loud and the quality didn t struggle at all Overall I am very happy with my choice I really like the design sound quality call quality durability and battery life Really good product recommend it to all I like this Sony Bluetooth speaker great sound Great base Bought for our boat great sound and look amazing Really better than JBL in all aspects Just received my ULT1 and it does not disappoint Easy to setup with both my Apple and Android phone I was playing music within seconds of opening the box Very impressed with the sound clarity and volume level The ULT button is also great for an extra bass boost I am personally a fan of the carry cord allowing me to hang the speaker outside by the pool Added bonus I got a phone call while listening to music and was very impressed with the call quality Sony nailed it with this new speaker Highly recommend Happy travel with this little Sony portable speaker I got 2 of these speakers so I could use the stereo function I am very happy with the sound quality It s like using headphones without the hassle or discomfort of headphones You need to use the sony app to set them up in stereo mode The media could not be loaded Sound is amazing for such a lil thing I purchased it to used outside by the pool area and its loud Battery lasted the whole time we were there compared to other brands this baby right here is so worth it Easy to use and even has and option to add more than one at a time The media could not be loaded I have seen YouTube videos on these new line of speakers from Sony I saw the new hype on this ULT button and it s supposed to put that bass into the music I was skeptical on that buuuut after playing music and pressing the button Yep my new favorite speaker for size and sound it is very clear Bass hits nicely it s tight and clean I like bass in everything I listen to Plus now I can ride my bike with the family and the speaker is not swaying around and banging around from the strap it has hanging from my handle bars like my last speaker did This new one from Sony fits in the water bottle holder I just pulled the metal back a little Also kinda fits in the cup holder off the car For a smaller speaker this has great sound But I do recommend pressing the ult button to really enjoy it It paired fast to my Samsung phone with a prompt on the screen I used it over the weekend cleaning up outside It says it s water and dust proof so I was able to just wash it off after having outside all day It really surprised me how much sound has for its size plus seeming durable makes it great to use anywheree This speaker is what You would Expect Sony to be made with Quality I love it Looking forward to upgradeing again in a few years I will Admit it s a little different Without the lights but it s ok it Makes up foreign in sound quality love the String to carry it great job Sony The media could not be loaded OK so it has been a few years since I have purchased a wireless speaker and only did so now because my JBL would no longer hold a charge I went to a store to listen to different speakers and decided to go with the Sony since I already have the headphones and am very happy The sound in the store was good enough but after actually ordering mine here and putting it in my office WOW I highly recommend this product and when you get it push that button on top that says ULT You will be pleasantly surprised We needed a small speaker last year and we ended up having to go with a bigger Sony XG300 to get the bass that we wanted Fast forward to this new guy the Field 1 is the perfect field speaker We ve taken this baby to basketball games BBQs even a day in the park and it does not disappoint It packs a ton of punch for such a small speaker Well done Sony Wow This sounds so good for the size The bass gets crazy with the ULT button pressed even outside I love it Oh and the speaker phone feature works amazing Nobody could tell I was using my speaker to talk I was so pleased with the bass and all around sound this little speaker puts out Best BT speaker I have ever purchased Just got my speaker If I m being honest the sound is much better than I expected for a smaller speaker I bought it for an adventurous family trip we are going on next week but I m sure it won t take long before my kids steal it from me lol So far I love it and recommend it Absolutely blown away by this little powerhouse Despite its compact size this Bluetooth speaker delivers crisp clear sound with impressive bass Perfect for any setting from the pool or beach to cozy indoor evenings The battery life is phenomenal and pairing is a breeze The ULT button really packs a punch to whatever you re listening to Highly recommend for anyone seeking top notch audio in a portable package I have to say I was a little hesitant to purchase a small speaker because they typically won t product the low bass well not to mention midrange tones sometimes sound weak I knew in seconds however this speaker delivers and exceeded my expectations I love the color and the design is awesome The low bass response even at low volume was amazing This has quickly become my favorite portable speaker Sound Quality is excellent and bass is good for a small Bluetooth speaker Amazing clear sound A V tech Even when cutting out all the bass from the EQ within the Android volume menu and downloading the Sony Music Center app and doing the same there are frequencies that still rumble through I want to listen to a podcast in the morning without deep voices and intro music burping through my apartment walls I ll keep it because music sounds great the sale was right and I like the funky orange Awesome little speaker that gets loud and so far seems to be extremely durable I used the included strap to tie it down to my SUP in the bay and it performed great even after getting a little wet Easy to set up sound is great for the size use outside by the pool plan to buy another Decent price Sounds great for it s size Such rich and full sound from a portable speaker Sounds great outdoors too Overpowers the sounds of the cicadas in the Midwest Deep bass and clear sound at any volume The color is great The sound is amazing Well worth the money Light weight and great sound for the pool Shipped very quickly also The sound is awesome Much better than expected The Blue Tooth connection was flawless via the APP Also via the APP all of my music library and Amazon Music is displayed and can be selected and played I have a bunch of Bluetooth speakers including older Sonys this one has really amazing sound Completely worth the money Nice form factor and incredibly light Doesn t lose bass when you increase the volume either I listen to various types of music and it reproduced them fairly accurately Does well listening to podcasts and videos as well A The ULT speaker sound is extremely impressive for such a small portable speaker Definitely the best speaker I have had The battery life is awesome and I love this color Very low quality compared with what we ve grown to just be there with Sony Two Sony SRS 10 s still rule This speaker sounds amazing Super clear loud and great balance Also love the color and battery life It is great Not as loud as the older Sony SRS XB20 which was the same size This little baby packs a punch Sorry to say I was disappointed with this one I have a few different models of Sony bluetooth speakers and overall I ve been more than happy with them I was hoping this model would serve as an upgrade to one of my older speakers While the bass was fantastic the overall tone much too trebly I had to return it for that reason Yes I played with the EQ settings Again my experiences with Sony s speakers have all been quite good So I was quite surprised that this one didn t work out First of all the build quality is pretty good I ordered the grey one and it was nice But unfortunately that s where all the praise for me ends Had this for about a week The battery life at medium volume lasted me on average about 6 and a half to 7 hours Not quite what is advertised Plus the sound really wasn t that great as others claimed And it did not get loud enough for my preference It s an OK speaker but not for the 128 price range At best maybe 79 99 would be more appropriate All in all not bad but not as good as some of these reviewers are making it out to be Nice little speaker but not worth more than 50 60 Battery life is terrible Have to keep it on a charger They didn t mention that little detail My old Sony SRS XB31 is louder and sounded better but they don t make them anymore I like the color and sound is ok and ULT mode brings the quality up to what I would expect from Sony The ULT mode should be able to do more I paid 100 I ll probably keep it The Sony ULT Field 1 speaker besides sounding great is also lightweight rugged and portable In fact the speaker tucks away nicely in my backpack s water bottle compartment and conveniently travels with me wherever I go and because it is shockproof water dust and rust resistant gets used in environments where I would normally think otherwise not to Furthermore the extra bass provided by the ULT toggle does a great job of creating a richer fuller music experience With all things being considered this speaker s abundant features makes this my go to portable speaker Just to summarize my thoughts on the ULT Field 1 quickly Some pros Good quality audio Dustproof waterproof etc SpeakerphoneSome cons Lacks good bass despite it s ULT button It s not terrible but it really seems to be hit and miss I don t get why it varies but it s not what I expected Battery lifeFabric lined with silicone ends it s fairly standard looking for a bluetooth speaker A strap runs across the entire back which is useful for holding onto or hanging the speaker Utilizes bluetooth obviously its is compatible with BT 5 3 and it supports Google Fast Pair I didn t realize at first but you can link two units in the app for stereo playback The control panel is a simple and intuitive layout Power Bluetooth pairing play volume up down and ULT The play button will also answer or end calls and it will navigate tracks You get a cover on the back which protects the USB C port Charging with USB C is great to see by the way and they include a USB A to USB C charging cable with the speaker The speaker itself is IP67 rated which means completely dustproof and can be submerged at a depth of up to one meter for up to 30 minutes I don t plan on using this as a speakerphone but it works well enough but you need to stay fairly close to the speaker as the signal doesn t seem particularly strong Battery life just seems lackluster just like the ULT bass Sony says approximately 12 hours at volume 25 50 with the ULT function turned on If you play at 100 volume with ULT on that drops to 3 hours You can use the STAMINA function in the app for reduce power consumption Speaking of battery life and the app when pair with your phone you are able to see the speakers remaining battery life on your phone Overall it s fine It s nothing special and even at the affordable price I think there are better options out there from some of the big name competitors I wasn t sure whether or not to give it 3 or 4 stars I d give it 3 5 if that were an option but it s not so I rounded up First I d like to say that this speaker has very nice appeal It looks very nice sitting in an office or even just on a shelf The small design is very well made You can tell the difference right away when you first pick up this speaker that it is not cheaply made not that I would expect nothing less form Sony or any other vendor of this caliber and the design aspects are on point to be beautiful and functional at the same time with much attention to detail of the design The thing that I wasn t impressed with is the sound I think this speaker works well at low volumes If you intend to listen to your music alone or in an office setting then this may work for you but don t engage in any high expectations from this speaker As I mentioned earlier if you set it on a low volume the sound is really not that bad I would recommend turning on the ULT button and never turning it off again for the life of the speaker This gives it a much fuller sound at low volumes and if you close your eyes and listen then you just might hear a hint of bass coming through If your mischievous and you do decide to turn the volume up more than half way then you wil begin to NOT enjoy the tinny sound coming from the speaker as the clarity immediately fades away I could say that this little speaker is surprisingly loud but Sony is not all about loud it is more about uality That it has a solid build quality is more or less a given reliability and connectivity too The Sony Ult field 1 speaker hearkens back to their XB series That is it has the familiar form and if you have seen it a lot that is the speaker the others were imitating Like all of Sony s portable speakers that I am aware of it is rated ip67 for water and dust resistance It is pretty rugged but don t throw it in a pool It is not 100 waterproof Sony doesn t play a lot of tricks to distract you from mediocre sound because it isn t Like few other companies which make portable blue tooth speakers Sony does provide some audio spec because ther3 is nothing to hide Unlike most other portable blue tooth speakers this small speaker has full range sound 20 hz to 20 khz They don t brag about their tuning because they do not have to tweak it to cover the missing detail All that said the sound is rich and details While you do not see a prominent bass boost it is essentially built in and the ult button does provide that boost should you want it The Field one is pretty pared down no flashing or pulsating lights just great sound It may not be the loudest put there but it is absolutely loud enough I listened to it outdoors yesterday and despite its size it holds up well to open air listening It is also very easy to use with dedicated buttons for each function The one surprise to me is that there are no high res blue tooth codecs and no aux in but then if you are using aux in it is somewhat less portable This one is very portable easy to carry easy to use easy to listen to I haven t found anything which does not sound good on this speaker but that is what you get with a full range speaker I buy a lot of Sony equipment because it is reliable in so many ways build quality sound quality stable connections and up to date protocols At the end of the day yes this little speaker sounds louder than you would expect from its size but also richer fuller and with great clarity and detail I ve always been a huge fan of Sony bluetooth speakers because they offered great quality build and sound While the Sony quality is still there I m not sure the sound is up to par with their past offerings There s a lot of competitors in this space and what set Sony apart from them was that they really focused on making a great sounding speaker including a live sound mode extra bass all with having stereo drivers Unfortunately the stereo drivers have been abandoned so that means no more spatial live sound mode which sounded great BTW The extra bass is still there but that s there in most all of the models around this price range Bose and JBL both mostly abandoned stereo drivers a while back but Sony still held out and I rewarded them with my purchases Now I don t really see much difference between a Sony JBL and many of the other players on the market Tribit etc Granted a bluetooth speaker is typically not a critical listening device but the Sony s of the past were borderline audiophile in their implementation They by far had the best stereo implementation out of a single box bluetooth speaker Whatever DSP magic they built into them was fantastic That magic is unfortunately gone for this speaker line The bass on the Sony is still really good though I played a 50hz test tone and was able to hear the tone clearly Many so called extra bass speakers can t even come close to playing a note that low so the Sony still does a fantastic job in that area The build is still good typical of what you d expect a Sony to be This speaker does lack a 3 5mm input jack though which I m not sure why as it could have easily been put next to the USB C port that s under a rubber cover Bluetooth connectivity was easy Fortunately no ridiculous LED lights on this model so I am thankful for that In the past Sony did give the option to turn them off or make them a solid color vs always having them flash to the beat of the music like other brands forced upon you I did not try TWS as I do not have two of the units However this would likely be the best way to listen to them as I d love to hear a stereo image from a pair of these My curiosity might get the best of me and if so I will update this review at that time I m not sure why Sony abandoned their last few generations of bluetooth speakers so quickly Seems like just last year or so the best bluetooth speaker they ve ever made IMO the SRS XBx3 specifically the XB43 was being cleared out for the new XG series Now we re getting the ULT series after a short amount of time I don t want to say that this new series sounds poor as it certainly does not But it s just another mono speaker now and seems to be made for the poolside beach party rather than listening more critically in a kitchen or bedroom Granted it does have a lot of low and quality bass so that mojo has not went away but the live sound modes and dual L R drivers disappearing is a disappointment So as a long time Sony bluetooth speaker fan I am a bit disappointed in the direction that they ve taken with the ULT lineup They still make some of the best bluetooth speakers available but their focus now seems to be headed in a different direction If that direction is a pool party or other outdoor party type of environment this speaker will serve you very well and is certainly the quality and clear sound that you d expect from the Sony name If you have one of their older stereo speakers and enjoy it hold onto that as this version will likely only be a suitable replacement if you buy two of them for TWS mode This speaker has beautiful quality and lots of power behind it There is o tinniness or feedback of any sort and it is so easy to transport and take wherever you need and wherever you want to go I would give it like 100 stars for the quality alone I am however having problems connecting to the speaker with several of my devices currently despite troubleshooting for multiple attempts I am hopeful to sort this soon and I am sure if I contact the manufacturer I would get assistance but eww phone calls It either pops up immediately as expected or it nowhere to be found so I am baffled as to how that is happening Anyway it is a very high quality device and I am happy with it regardless Featuring enhanced bass this Bluetooth speaker is compact and has noticeable weight for its size which gives it a quality feel It arrives with a one foot long USB A to USB C charging cable and while it may be operated manually as a standard Bluetooth speaker it may also be controlled by the Sony Music Center app which to fully utilize all the features requires at least a second speaker A small reference guide is included but a UPC code is provided on the underside of the box lid for an online version of a more detailed manual For a Bluetooth speaker where portability is the point the sound is surprising good clear and precise although at higher volumes reproduction is somewhat tinny The bass boost adds depth which seems all the more necessary in an outdoor setting where acoustics are non existent Overall at this price point the speaker has an excellent sound and a solid build If interested operation details follow On arrival I plugged it into a USB A charging port during which a small orange LED light located below the power button was illuminated and when fully charged the light went out After gently pressing the power button a small green light and a small blue light are illuminated If familiar with Bluetooth pairing the operation is straightforward and if not information is available in the manual Ready to listen to music I manually connected the speaker to my iPhone music library The touch control panel at the top of the speaker includes a power Bluetooth play pause volume minus plus along with the ULT bass boost control A water resistant trap door at the back of speaker covers a USB C port for charging There is a built in omnidirectional microphone to use during phone calls The location is not obvious but it is approximately an inch to the right of the control panel and an inch below Battery life is stated to be 12 hours at level 25 volume which is approximately 50 percent and at full volume 3 hours The ends on the speaker have a rubberized bumper which should offer some shock protection if dropped The IP67 rating means it is dustproof and water resistant in up to 3 feet of water for a maximum of 30 minutes It has a simple removable woven strap for transporting the device There are a handful of names that are instantly recognizable in the world of electronics and Sony is one of them Whatever consumer electronics you buy whether a TV stereo or whatever if it has the Sony label on it you expect it to be good That is part of the brand This speaker delivers the quality you d expect from Sony I have a number of bluetooth speakers and some are just ok This Sony speaker has great sound and isn t too big or bulky It has a nice rope like handle for carrying It connects easily via bluetooth and feels durable The quality of the speaker seems excellent It has a ton of extra features which I have not tested Honestly I don t often pair multiple speakers or use my speakers for phone calls but it s nice to know this speaker has those features if you need them For me bluetooth speakers need to have good sound and be mobile as I often take them on the go This speaker delivers on both fronts You can certainly pay less for a no name speaker that gives ok sound and features But this speaker is very reasonably priced and as I stated with the Sony brand you pretty much already know the quality is going to be good It is Only the Tribit Stormbox Flow has louder deep bass than the Sony Ult 1 in this size category But the Flow also only has one driver and it just doesn t sound as detailed even if you adjust the EQ using the Tribit app for more clarity I would rather have the Sony Ult 1 as my go to small speaker for overall performance That said for 128 at time of review there are other speakers that I would direct your attention as better alternatives if you don t mind the size being bigger The Lonzuer Action is the speaker on the left in the picture It s not much heavier and at time of this review it is 108 99 and gets louder with much fuller bass than the Sony Ult 1 It features a back firing speaker at the rear that when put close to a wall but not against the wall really helps fill up a room It s retro look is sleek it has bass volume and treble knobs on top for quick adjustment It has louder bass than a JBL Xtreme 2 The MLove A200 is a gem It s the off white and gold speaker in the pic This thing has MEGA bass I was shocked at how good it sounds relative to it s price It has volume bass and treble knobs It gets loud but with controlled bass It really is at the price of 90 at time of review a steal in terms of sound per dollar It s my go to when I don t want to lug a bigger partybox or the Stormbox Blast around Lastly the DOLPHIN LX90 at 120 at time of this review is a real party speaker It has tight punchy deep bass and it should it s a huge speaker It s mids and highs are kind of a mess it s not meant for critical listening It s just big dumb fun The A200 and the LX 90 are pretty neck and neck in terms of overall bass But the LX90 gets loud making it a great budget boombox There you have it this is a great speaker for it s size It has a 3 band EQ in the Music Center app instead of a 5 band for the ULT 7 But I laid out some alternatives in the price range that should be considered They are all louder with more bass than this ULT1 I was very disappointed with the ULT7 if you are considering that monstrously overpriced thing go read my review on it TLDR Wow great speaker in love so far We got the bright orange color and it looks absolutely great It definitely pops and is a bit of a wow factor so if you like more subtle colors for electronics etc you may want to go with one of the other color options I have several Sony speakers from the past years and this one is definitely up there with my favorites My other favorite has lights that go to the music this one does not include that but instead is a lot more portable which I love Main reason for loving this speaker and Sony in general is the bass A lot of other speakers around this price range that are actually portable just don t sound good enough to me bc I don t get enough bass This one has a button labeled ULT which I believe means Ultimate Well that button brings in bass or takes it away and wow what a difference it makes turning it on It isn t bass that has too much vibration either it really does completely compliment all sounds of the music playing I also utterly love that it was sooo easy to pair to my phone Literally turn on Bluetooth on both and find the right speaker and pair It does have an app you can use for all kinds of equalizer options which is great for customizing how you listen to music and being able to change things around depending on your taste I am super content with the default settings but it s nice to know that is an option for classical music or other unique sounds I have not tested the waterproof level or ruggedness and I love this speaker so much I don t really want to get it dirty or wet But it seems rugged made out of great materials and absolutely great to throw in a bag for a trip or mini adventure Highly recommend Sony really hit a home run with their ULT line up Already own the 7 series Which is loud and powerful while delivering a warm solid bass I wanted something smaller that I can leave in the car This unit is about 8 inches long and a bit bigger than 3 inch in diameter The speaker came fully charged and was wrapped nicely in a white cloth bag The only accessory that comes with is a USB Type C cable Upon turning on the speaker my phone immediately recognized the speaker with an icon of the speaker Asked me if I wanted to pair the speaker and about 1 minute later My phone with paired with the speaker Having own other brands and off brands I think Sony is really stepping up their game with the portable sound system I played a few classical music like from Mozart and Beethoven The mids and high are nice and crisp The bass is tight and doesn t sound muddy At 50 this speaker really rhunpa and sounds great There was no hint of any distortion once I turned the volume up to 80 Also tested this speaker with some 80 old school rap hip hop Man does this little speaker really put out the bass and juice It got so loud my wife has walked into the living room and asked me to turn it down Overall this is a rich sounding and powerful bass speaker system It definitely will live in the vehicle when we re out relaxing somewhere outdoor The only gripe is not sure what to do with the Paracord type it s loop from end of the speaker to the next So I might just remove it Also it has a IP 67 rating so it will be perfect for the outdoors when I go camping So anyone who s looking to get a small powerful rich sounding speaker Check out Sony s ULT line up and give it a chance You won t be disappointed I ve been really happy with a pair of Sony ULT Wear headphones so I was interested in seeing if this bluetooth speaker the ULT Field 1 would be as impressive It turns out that it is a really good portable speaker One thing I liked was having a color choice I m getting weary of having all black devices so being able to get an off white speaker the same as my headphones was a pleasure You can also get gray or orange orange really instead of black or off white but they didn t have the vibe I wanted Nice to have the choice though Now on to the speaker s sound It s pretty remarkable I wanted to give it a true test so I first put it on the other side of the room about twenty feet away and let it do its thing using the ULT feature I thought it might sound boomy but it actually had a nicely balanced sound across a range of music genres The sould filled the area nicely and apart from its not having a stereo soundstage sounded like a quality set of home speakers I was surprised and very pleased In shorter distances I turned off the ULT feature and it still sounded great without excess bass response at all The speaker itself is a good size too not too large like some of the behemoths you see these days Still portable and described as waterproof and dustproof too Very cool Its charge time and duration are very reasonable actually better than most bluetooth speakers I ve had of about that size So you can see that I have nothing negative to say about this Sony product I expect it to be my main bluetooth speaker henceforth and plan to use it both indoors and out Good product The Sony ULT1 is pretty nice offering It has the typical tall beer can size like the JBL Flip but is relatively light in a good way I particularly like the parachute cord strap as nice feature I compared the speaker to my two current favorites in size range the Klipsch Nashville and the Bose Soundlink Flex overall both speakers beat the Sony for sound quality The Klipsch is something special sound wise but is quite a bit heavier in size the Soundlink has a better out of the box sound with EQ the Sony come very close Ultimately the neither is a bad choice the Sony is 20 dollars cheaper but the Bose is frequently on sale So while Sony isn t the winner it still makes the podium and is good entry I ve own owned and have worn out Sony products out This One is no exception It looks and feels like Sony quality Great sound quality and a even better battery life One of the best speakers I have and one of my favorites Pros An actual premium Bluetooth speaker After trying a lot of random off brand Bluetooth speakers with mixed results it s nice to use a name brand product that performs and just works The sound quality is fantastic I don t know that it s quite audiophile level but any range of music I ve tried on this thing sounds great which is usually my test of a new sound device Very light portable and waterproof So you can pretty much take it anywhere you want Battery lasts long enough you probably only need to charge it in between sessions Classic Sony style that looks good in black wasn t brave enough to order orange Cons A little pricey maybe If you want true stereo sound you need to buy and pair a second speaker That said it s nice it has the option at all and it sounds pretty good by itself A great product if you want portable sound to take anywhere This isn t going to be a cheap throwaway speaker and I m pretty sure it s among the best you can get for this type of product It s almost unbelievable how this relatively tiny speaker produces such a loud an clear sound Bass boost makes a lot of difference and it is easy to turn off if you don t enjoy that or on certain songs where it can get a little muddled Battery life is great it is light portable and waterproof which makes it a perfect adventure companionGreat speaker I could not believe how loud and good the sound is out of this little tiny Bluetooth speaker Just amazing I also have never owned a device the paired so effortlessly with my phone I turned the speaker on and my phone gave me a button prompt and it was paired The fact that this thing is waterproof makes it an awesome choice for taking on the boat but also for taking camping or to connect to for gaming while traveling or even pairing microphones for amplification at outdoor events The potential uses for this speaker are endless Really an outstanding product I didn t expect much from this speaker I figured it would just blend in with the other speakers that I have around the house I was wrong as this has become my favorite portable BT speaker The sound quality is really nice for a speaker of this size It has pretty good bass but not overpowering The app allows you to set a custom 3 band EQ and update the speaker Lightweight nice sound perfect for travel I ll just be right up front and to the point This speaker does not impress me at all The speaker itself feels like a solid construction But the audio doesn t give me any wow reactions the app that you can use with this speaker is very blah and seems like it s just thrown together Nothing about the app is inviting Almost seems like the app was an after thought The performance of the speaker is very underwhelming Not seeing much value for your money It s easy to use That s a plus And the Bluetooth connectivity is ok Seems to hold a stable Bluetooth connection Overall this would not be a speaker I would purchase If I did happen to purchase this speaker I would submit for a return Perfect and portable the speaker is amazing for parties it lost me all day on a single charge Bluetooth connection is instant and easy and the sound quality is crisp Out of the box the sound lacks bass and some highs Downloading the app and tweaking the EQ makes these speakers really sing I put on some Steely Dan and played with the EQ for 5 minutes and then they were good to go They remember the previous EQ setting when you next use them so you don t have to adjust every time I bought two so I could pair them into stereo mode They sound good and produce stereo sound alone but two together is quite impressive These are replacing an old pair of JBL Flip 4 s The Flips were fine but the battery life was fading I would use them at moderate volume about an hour per day and I would have to charge twice a week The new Motion are a bit larger louder sound better and the battery life is 2 3X longer Overall excellent speakers for the price so far No Bluetooth connection problems and they seem to be solid and high quality Highly recommended if you re willing to get the Soundcore app and tweak the EQ for a few minutes I uploaded a photo of my settings Try making yours similar to mine and see how it goes This is the best speaker for the money out there I have owned this for 3 years and have taken it everywhere never missing a beat Yes pun The sound quality on this is pretty good out of the box but some EQ ing on the app makes this really come alive with a vibrant sound I cannot emphasize enough how much improvement a makes for this portable speaker For me this really loves a V shaped EQ as the mids are pretty forward and dominant out of the box The hardware itself is great but the tuning is pretty average out of the box If you don t mind dialing it in yourself it is well worth the 5 10 minutes it takes to set it and forget it This has a pretty wide range for such a moderately sized speaker This speaker boasts a generous capacity for bass and has excellent sound separation It seems to have 2 mid range drivers 2 high range and one sub I initially used this as a little soundbar for my desktop pc but now it is my daily driver I have used it nearly every day for 3 years and it has been rocksteady the whole while The battery life is still excellent too Back to the EQ this benefits from a bit of extra sub bass generous mid bass amplification and moderate upper mids and treble With that set up this little guy really becomes vibrant Being a smaller speaker the bass is obviously going to be somewhat limited but for the size it is surprisingly present I would describe the bass as present clean and generally responsive For durability I may not be the best person to ask because I m generally pretty protective of this thing but it has been in a backpack hundreds of times and even dropped a few slight drops Other than a small dent from one such drop there is no real sign of wear All in all I would highly recommend this speaker for anyone who wants the best possible sound quality for the money I ve owned a number of Bluetooth speakers in my life and my complaint is usually the same on anything that doesn t include a high price tag Most are muffled lack clarity and are particularly bad on the low end I ve read the countless reviews on the Soundcore Motion and finally decided to try it out I m very glad I did as it s by far the best smaller Bluetooth speaker for the price or less that myself or friends have enjoyed Pros Sound quality is very good for what I listen to and I listen to a lot of genres of music movies shows and racing I love the size and weight of it It s built very well It might be a bit too large heavy if you like small ultra light weight speakers Bluetooth connectivity has been excellent the app works great I really like the stock EQ settings as well as the custom EQ Value compared to the well known name brands is exceptional I love the rubber on the top and bottom of the speaker On slippery surfaces it grips well and on the top it s a nice soft touch The top does show fingerprints but those are really easy to clean off I prefer that to just plastic or cloth by far I ve not had it out in the direct rain but I ve had it out in very high humidity conditions and have spilled water on it and it didn t affect it at all It just made it easier to clean The 15 degree angle of the speaker is awesome if you re sitting down or standing up It definitely makes a difference if you have it lower than ear level listening Cons I wish it had a mute button I wish it had a battery life indicatorNeither con is enough to deduct a star from it though You can obviously mute it from your device or see the battery life in the app but when I m full screen watching something live it would be nice to easily see battery life or mute on the device itself especially when I have it hooked up to my mini PC On a phone or tablet that is in your hand or right next to you then it s not a big deal at all Overall this speaker is flat out awesome I m very happy with my purchases and I look forward to seeing what Soundcore can come out with in the future A larger version of this with some more low end bass would be the best of all worlds in my opinion I just wish I wouldn t have overlooked it for so long because it wasn t a big name speaker brand At this price and above it s the real deal This is going to be long winded but I ll likely answer a lot of your questionsMy intended purpose was to replace an aging Bose SoundLink Mini 1 that I was using for music in my garage gym The SoundLink mini is an impressive speaker when it s size is taken into account They provide a deep full sound and produce great bass but struggle when turned up much past 60 at least mine does but it is old What I wanted was a speaker that could get louder while still producing a quality sound I found that in the Motion When I first unboxed it I noticed that it is heavy and has a very solid build It is however it s not beautiful The rubberized outside feels good and feels like quality and there are two rubber feet on the bottom to keep it in place When first powered up you are greeted with the power up and pairing tones They are honestly less annoying than others I have heard though I know of no way to disable them Pairing was VERY fast and straightforward and I can get a good distance away I didn t measure though without hiccups It comes out of the box with Bass Up mode enabled Listen Bass Up mode sucks It honestly should be called Treble Down mode Yes it increases the bass but not as much as you can in the custom EQ I played a few songs in Bass Up mode just to see what I heard and as stated above did NOT like it I then played with the provided EQ settings in the app I think if you are going to choose a canned EQ setting from the Soundcore app the heavy one is decent After that I played with the custom EQ settings and the speaker really started to come to life Once you settle on an EQ setting you like the SPEAKER retains those settings So even if you pair it with a different device it will still play with your EQ settings Now I also have a built in EQ on my OnePlus 6T and decided to try that First I turned off the custom EQ settings on the speaker best way to do that is to hit the BassUp button on the speaker twice Once turns on the BassUp profile and a second one turns BassUp off reverting to bassoff mode My OnePlus EQ has some general enhancements setting that I applied and I played with the sliders and it sounded pretty awesome Then I applied my custom Soundcore app s EQ on top of that and WOW One EQ was awesome and two were even better My next major test will be to try the speaker from different sources I have access to a couple Samsung S9s some android tablets etc I don t own any iPhones so I can t test that out I ll update my review after doing more testing I played with it for a few hours yesterday and even played it a bit in my car on the way to work this morning I did find that the sound actually seemed to change slightly after playing a while I don t know if speaker break in is real or not but I believe that the bass has become fuller and warmer after a few hours use I ll update on this aspect as well I am eclectic when it comes to music so I ll give a quick rundown of the types I ve tried and what I thought Country music I played several Chris Stapleton songs and I felt this showcased the speaker the absolute best All the instrumentation came through warm and clear Heavy Metal This is a WIDE genre and will likely be what is most often played on this speaker it s for my gym remember I found that industrial metal Rammstein NIN etc needed a little massaging in the EQ to separate sounds better but sounded great afterward I ended up leaving these minor adjustments in place because they helped all the other music too Atreyu FFDP Volbeat etc all sounded powerful loud and full Rap Honestly on day one I was ready to say that this speaker just sucks for beat driven hip hop music However after playing with the settings and letting it break in if that s a thing I was wrong For example I recently played come and see me by Ludacris which relies heavily on a bass line that varries from low to really low with some thumps thrown in I could hear all the deep frequencies the slightly higher bass tones and the periodic thumps moved my speaker After that I threw on UGK s Gravy which also relies heavily on bass and it sounded fantastic Now how about that bass since that s why most of you are here This speaker is able to play really low frequencies but it will NOT hit you in your chest You will hear all the bass but you wont feel the bass why Because it s a freaking portable bluetooth speaker not your home theater system your bookshelf system or your car stereo If you want to FEEL the bass in your chest or whatever you ll need to pony up for a speaker with enough size to resonate those sound waves Doing so you ll likely lose a lot in portability and whatnot However I have heard that the w king D8 is a good bass head speaker Check out some YouTube reviews or just order it it s super cheap Another thing to note is that the high frequencies are capable of getting louder than the low frequencies As you crank this up the bass will reach a point where there just isn t enough room inside the enclosure People say you lose bass as you increase volume but you don t you just stop increasing bass at a certain point while the treble keeps on going I ve ran mine at somewhere near 90 volume and I can tell you that the drivers are still increasing their work because the speaker basically starts having as seizure It s just that there isn t any more space inside to resonate the waves The reason and the ONLY reason this isn t getting a full five stars from me is that my speaker farts Yes you read that right but only when cranked to uncomfortable levels and bass heavy music There are a couple possible reasons for this I could be asking for the passive radiators to do too much I have two EQs after all It could just be the way it s designed although I have read a TON of reviews on here and Reddit and never seen anyone mention this Or my unit is defective somehow Think about that last one though If I DO have a defective unit and my review is still this good what does that tell you I will reach out to Anker Soundcore support just to ask some questions because their support is amazing I ve had other products from them and they provide the absolute best support I ve ever received To end for now this speaker really should be an automatic buy if you are looking for a portable BT speaker with high end sound under 100 If you are looking for slap you in the lungs bass get something LARGER I don t care what brand it is you can t get more real bass out of a package this size physics is physics Have been enjoying this speaker over a year Never had any problems I listen to most types of music with the exception of rap Classical music with its many layers is where this speaker shines It is easy to hear all the instruments with nothing being muffled The unit charges quickly and lasts for at least eight hours Fits nicely on a desk top I mostly use it when sewing and working out Great value and highly recommend The Soundcore Motion is an elegant design with excellent ergonomics that elevates this speaker above beyond It feels substantial in your hand and well built The volume controls located on the top of the speaker are perfectly centered between the bass drivers on either side and the front passive radiator which allows for easy navigation Technically the Motion excels with an AKM DSP featuring active crossovers for its four amps each with its own dedicated power supply silk dome tweeters which I believe are Scan Speak design bass drivers with large neodymium magnets coupled to two passive radiators and USB C charging It s a brilliant design that is supremely executed Hats off to the sound engineers that collaborated on this speaker Once you ve unboxed and charged your Motion you ll want to update the firmware and set up the custom EQ To do that you ll have to download the app To use Ankers Soundcore App you ll have to accept giving up a huge amount of personal data analytics so I chose to install the app on a tablet Just beware The Soundcore Motion will save your custom eq setting however you ll want to delete the Soundcore app and re download it to verify that the settings are correct The app will lower the sliders if they re in between whole dB s Once it s dialed in you shouldn t have to open the Soundcore app again You ll want to refrain from pushing the bass up button on the top left of the speaker since that bumps you off your Custom eq setting The only way to get back to your saved eq preset is from the Soundcore app I set the 9 bands of equalization all below flat to give the digital amplifiers extra headroom keeping any audible distortion at bay See attached photo Since this speaker isn t a three way and audible distortion is most prevalent at 1kHz I set that band to 5 dB Next is the lower and higher mid ranges at 700 Hz and 5kHz which I set to 4dB 500Hz and 8kHz are at 3dB while 300Hz and 12kHz are at 2dB Lastly keeping the bass strong I ve set 80 150Hz at 1dB So how does it sound It s airy and open projecting a surprisingly effective stereo image thanks to its silk dome tweeters mounted at the outside corners and tilted at a 15 angle It s balanced and capable with all genres of music from EDM to jazz reggae to heavy metal Horns piano and vocals are beautifully rendered by the tweeters juxtaposed by the bass capabilities of this speakers dual passive radiators On Spotify Amazon and Apple Music under shared playlists is my favorite titled Epic House Dance Music 4 The Soul Some stand out tracks from Epic House Dance Music 4 The Soul that sound fantastic on the Motion are Angels Feat Nora Jones Thievery Corporation Remix Wax Poetic Norah s voice floats around the room amazing stereo separation Lips Like Sugar Way Out West Remix Edit Echo The Bunnymen Punchy drums combined with some killer bass lines and melodic synth combined with sexy lyrics and a memorable rhythm guitar this track sounds great blasted all the way Radiation Ruling the Nation Protection Massive Attack Even at max the on purpose distortion in this track sounds so authoritative I Want You John Morales M M Main Mix Marvin Gaye This 9 36 long Masterpiece highlighted by bongos piano and saxophone are easily distinguished in the mix throw in Marvin s amazing tone and man is this song better than the original I think so An analog 3 5mm jack is provided for those times when Bluetooth is not an option however sound quality is best when left in the digital domain given the Motion s DSP Speaker placement is important for the Soundcore Motion to sound it s best A solid surface such as a granite counter top placed near a back wall or corner placement can help accentuate the low end punch of the Motion A helpful hint is to hover the speaker in whatever area you ve chosen and place the speaker when the bass moves your hand the most Placing the speaker just inches one way or another can have a dramatic effect This speaker excels indoors in moderate sized rooms and can sometimes struggle in larger rooms or when played outside The Motion puts out some serious SPL s for such a small device Have The Motion s USB C plugged into power along with using the speakers volume control not the source device when you re seeking the loudest output The longer I live with this speaker the more I appreciate it It s an attractive design that s understated yet compelling For example the power button glows white while powered on and changes to a blinking red when the speaker is running out of juice In this state it automatically plays at a reduced volume until plugged in Once plugged in to a charger via the USB C port the Motion increases in volume and continues to play while charging Nice touch I purchased a second Motion and my observations are that something magical happens with this speaker between the 3rd and 4th charging cycle Keep that in mind when listening to yours Critical listening should happen after the Motion is played for 30 hours In regards to Bluetooth connectivity I highly recommend having a dedicated music source other than your phone That awesome playlist playing from your phone while your phone is blowing up It ll be paused by the speaker from all the notifications I modded mine see photo by super glueing a convex item over the bass up button ensuring my speaker will always sound good The Soundcore Motion is a technical marvel of inspired engineering I am consistently blown away by its performance Highly recommended This is such a beautiful speaker that sounds really amazing especially for it s size I haven t updated the firmware on any of the 3 Motion Pluses that I bought or downloaded the app yet so my review is what I think of them straight out of the box Anyway when I first spotted these things on Amazon I just knew that I had to have one and then 2 more after I got 1 of them Pros 1 Really really great sound out of these things even with the BassUp feature OFF 2 For larger rooms turning ON the BassUp features helps just enough with the bass in larger rooms without bogging down the sound 3 Tight punchy bass with or without the BassUp feature ON 4 Mids highs sound fantastic very clear with great instrument separation 5 Pairing 2 speakers together makes these sound even better for increased stereo separation and fullness of sound and the BassUp feature isn t needed as much when using 2 speakers 6 Beautiful design it s the best looking speaker that Anker has made to date in my opinion 7 IPX7 rated so it s completely waterproof 8 USB C charging and cable I think that the first charging time on one of mine was about 3 5 hours but charge faster with a better socket adapter or so I hear 9 Still has an 3 5mm stereo auxiliary jack and supplied cable 10 Battery level indicator shows up on my iPod even without Soundcore Motion application installed 11 Decent battery life 12 hours however one of mine so far haven t tested the others yet has exceeded the 12 hour mark I listen to it just below half volume and this is usually enough volume for me 12 This speaker sounds better and is louder than the Soundcore Pro the most comparable equivalent to this speaker 13 You can turn the BassUp feature ON and OFF with this Motion Plus speaker but you can t do that with the Soundcore Pro 14 There is an application download for this speaker that I hear has some nice features on it but you can still pair it up with another speaker to get a right left channel stereo paring without the app totally unlike the JBL flip 4s and JBLs which require their app to get their pair speakers out of Party Mode 15 It s a little wider physically than the Soundcore Pro and the Boost so the stereo separation is still a little better than other models even without having to pair it to another speaker POTENTIAL cons but ONLY if these things are important to you they are usually NOT a problem for me 1 Although it has good battery life the Soundcore Pro another Anker model has an 8000 milliamp battery 18 hours of battery life and this one is only a 6700 milliamp battery It might have been nice to get a little bit of a bigger battery in the Motion but it s not that disappointing to me that we didn t 2 The Soundcore Pro has a standard USB port so you can charge your phone from the speaker This is not important to me as I would rather just carry an extra Anker battery charging bank to charge my phone rather than use the speaker s battery 3 It doesn t have quite as much bass as the Soundcore Pro if you re primarily into really heavy bass which I am NOT This is NOT a con for me personally because I think that the Motion Plus has the perfect amount of bass with or without the BassUp turned ON I found that I always needed to EQ down the bass on the Soundcore Pro to get it where I personally liked it I don t have to do that with this speaker 4 This speaker is larger or wider than the Soundcore Pro and the Boost so if you re looking for something really small this speaker might not be quite as easy to carry around as the Boost or Pro This is not a problem for me at all though I actually like this feature a lot 5 No multi light battery indicator on the actual speaker itself but the power button does start flashing red when batteries are getting low It would have been nice to have battery level lights on the speaker but I am still okay with it showing up just on the iPod and or on the application 6 Has sizable quantized volume increases for every click of the volume button however these increases are NOT nearly as bad as the larger jumps in volume on the Soundcore Pro Only 3 of these potential cons represented any problem for me the battery play time no battery level indicator lights on speaker the sizable volume increasesHowever these issues still haven t seemed to have been that big of a deal so far because I get more than the expected battery time because the speaker is loud enough so I can just listen to it at lower volumes and get longer battery life that way Also I can track battery levels on my device and or application so this isn t much of an issue with me And as far as the sizable volume increase I seem to be able to micro adjust them when using my finger along the slider at least with the newer iPods and iPhones older ones seem a bit more jumpy Anyway this is a really great speaker and I highly recommend it NOTE If you like your mids and highs scaled back some then I would highly recommend the Soundcore Boost and if you really like a lot of bass with a dip in the mids I would then recommend the Soundcore Pro All 3 of these are good speakers though UPDATE 10 21 2020Problem Solved Anker Soundcore has contacted me and they have resolved the problem for me A great company and products As long as there is a good customer service and they can guaranty their products I can buy their products without worries Thanks AnkerUPDATE 10 11 2020I have been using this for few days Initially I have connected to my 3 devices my laptop amazon fire and my cell phone supposedly when I turn on soundcore it should be automatically connect to the previous device That it does however the main problem is that while playing the music gets cut off trying to connect to my other two devices So basically either I have to turn off my two other device bluetooth features or keep reconnecting the main device which is my laptop to listen to music I have many other Anker soundcore bluetooth speakers but none of them has this sort of problem except this Motion which is very strange to me so I have to return the product and lower the stars from 5 to 1 stars other complain is the bass I am not a bass head but surprisingly it does lack a lot of bass compared to my previous speakers Earfun Mid and high are pretty good but bass is still bit weak lastly battery life does not come close to what it advertises about 30 less than what it advertises bit of disappointment I always have been a big fan of Anker for many years I believe that I have bought at least 50 products from them since five years ago Before this purchase I had Earfun bluetooth speakers I bought two of them to use as stereo home system They worked great and sounded even better for about two weeks and a half then one of them went kaputt No power no charging just simply dead without any reason whatsoever so I had to look for another one I always had my eyes on this Soundcore Motion because of a lot of good reviews in youtube and I normally trust their quality and customer service Fortunately this one was on deal of the day at 69 99 So I picked it up right away Just by the weight it is heavy and I could tell that this has a lot of battery to play for a long time and it just felt good in my hand Everything looked substantial and fit finish was top notch As for the sound quality Yes it is good very refined high and clear mid vocal along with decent bass but bit weak compared to mid high However what made me to give 5 stars was the soundcore app I was able to control the frequencies with my phone soundcore app That was a huge point because not all music can be played at same frequency setting However I don t think that this motion can produce 30 watts as advertised it seems a lot low but it is okay Loud enough I know that it is the first day and normally I always am eager to put my review on Amazon Just like the Earfun perhaps in a week or two it might go bad If so then I will update my review But my initial impression is very impressive Thanks Soundcore Don t fall for the label of High Res Audio that many brands are putting on their speakers or headphones At least Sony has grounds to say so kinda as they support LDAC codec which is far better quality and resolution than even AptX LDAC 32bit 96kHz 990kbps vs AptX 16bit 48kHz 352kbps And I don t think they mean High Res for the AUX jack as that audio is processed by the source DAC not the speaker This Anker does have AptX but not the actual High Res version AptX HD AptX has been around since BT early days btw Since the very early 90 s and AptX HD was out in 2009 and yet u rarely see them on BT speakers despite their proven superior audio quality I can get this speaker to connect to my Pixel 3 via AptX and it does sound surprisingly good for its size It will only pair via SBC on my 2019 Nvidia Shield Pro SBC 16bit 44 1kHz 328kbps max I tried a Sony SRS XB32 That paired and used LDAC fine However it would have dropouts and pops every 30 sec or so I have 2 sets of different Sony headphones they use LDAC with no drop outs at all but a Fiio BTR3 with LDAC that does cut out I guess Shield is is picky My main use for this speaker is to replace a 10yr old Bose Soundlink 1 Bluetooth 2 0 speaker I read this is a BT 5 0 speaker and my 3 BT devices the Shield laptop and Pixel 3 are the same I use this for my laptop via Aux mostly and recently my new Shield for late night TV watching when my large sound system is disruptive to my apartment neighbors or asleep roomates Having 2 BT devices paired to this speaker at once my laptop via BT and my Shield for example when ever one devices makes a sound the speaker will go silent for about 3 secs then play the other source It auto switching back to the other device it seems is harder for it as it pauses for much longer 6 secs or so Most of the time i have to pause or restart playback on the previous device to get sound to play It is a little bit more gracefull when switching from the AUX source and the BT but it still is a bit of a pause and fade in out for a few secs Best to mute or just disconnect the other source to avoid your main source being interrupted constantly The Bass Up default sound profile is a tad muddy sounding but had good sounding lows for a speaker of this size Turning it off makes it sound too cheap and flat though At least one can use the Smartphone app if you pair it to your phone to use other profiles or a custom EQ I am still playing with the EQ Overall sound i would say lacks some clarity and definition from the Bose Soundlink 1 but it has far better lows Was hoping the tweeters this Anker has would be closest to the Bose not quite it seems Bose does make very good products but are overpriced But i got the Soundlink speaker years ago at a Goodwill for 5 sooo Compare to the Sony SRS XB32 which is a more expensive speaker this Anker has better raw sound to me Overall more clarity definition and more separation Bass is tad deeper sounding up close the Sony has a different design and seemed to output the deeper lows more front wise and could be heard better further away in that aspect When using LDAC however the Sony shines despite the difference in no tweeters and different drivers The Sony however only supports SBC and LDAC for some reason so if i wanted to use my laptop via BT it uses SBC The Sony also if u have a AUX cable plugged in it is locked to AUX mode can t use BT unless you unplug cable make it not usable for me Using the EQ in the Anker Sound core app to make it more my taste I really do like the sound this speaker produces however doing so I can very much hear the poor quality and compression of SBC codec when playing music vids from my Emby Media Server from my Shield Source audio files are FLAC or WAV It really too bad this thing wont pair using AptX Using my phone and AptX it is much better sound Laptop also will connect via AptX and sounds great too but not as great as when using AUX of course but good enough that i may decide to ditch my Creative USB sound card that is eating up one of the 2 usb ports on the laptop The USB C jack on this Anker is welcome coming from a AC to DC adapter Barrel plug to charge The top buttons are pretty much invisible on this thing They blend in to much and are quite small hard to find by feel alone as well The power button on the side has a LED in it so that is easy to find but i would prefer power on the top along with the other buttons Gotta give this speaker a bit more time to get adjusted to It had a 15 off coupon sale when i purchased it here so it makes it even more worth the lower cost than the Sony but it still is a disappointment for use as I mainly wanted with my Shield with AptX EDIT After a week of using this speaker discovered some more quirks The speaker does NOT remember the volume settings after you or it auto shuts off This is especially annoying for use of AUX as the volume is way to low and u have to press the Vol up button several times each time the speaker is powered up The EQ you set in the app does not function when using AUX There is NO low battery notification at all Only the power button LED blink red when u try to turn it on then it turns off No way to know the battery status while in use or at power up the Sony speaker had an option to announce battery level at each power on and by default had verbal battery low notifications on the speaker several before it finally would die So unless you have this paired to a supported phone at all times and monitor via the app the battery charge you have no idea on battery level those BT battery level in the phones OS is often very delayed and inaccurate in my experience with other battery powered BT devices Battery life could be better for a speaker this size and weight I have a much smaller Soundcore 2 and that is years old and lasts hours longer than this speaker Not a big deal for me as I can just leave this speaker plugged into usb power from my hub most of the time The speaker itself is very good has a lot of power for the size and I can usually crank it up to 100 without any clipping and almost no distortion if any at all after adjusting the EQ settings more on that later The layout of the drivers and the fact that there are 5 of them in this tiny package absolutely fills the sound stage and the DSP does a very good job of balancing the power between them all The battery lasts quite a while long enough for a day trip or party multiple times over and it doesn t seem to lose much charge when unused for a few days at a time The portability is fine it is a bit heavy and decently large so you won t be putting it in your pocket and can t really comfortably hold it in your hands for more than a few minutes but that s probably not what you would be buying a speaker like this for anyways That said I do have a few issues some of which are major and should be extremely easy to fix and I honestly am surprised that anyone in this day and age would leave these features out these issues being that 1 Every time you turn on the speaker it defaults to it s god awful Bass Up aka Destroy the sound quality EQ that makes everything sound TERRIBLE When I first got this speaker turned it on and played something I heard the awful cacophony and immediately turned the speaker off and put it back in the box ready to return it Then I remembered I read a review that said the default EQ was awful and that the app allows you to change it and changing it to anything other than the Bass Up or Bass Off Bass off sounds like the awful cacophony but without any bass makes this speaker absolutely shine The problem with this solution You HAVE to have it connected to your phone and you HAVE to use the app to change the EQ EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU TURN ON THE SPEAKER On the speaker itself you can switch between Bass Up and Bass Off but you cannot set a default EQ you cannot save a custom EQ from the 9 band custom EQ and you cannot disable the Bass Up from being defaulted on every time you turn on the speaker Because the speaker sounds so awful out of the box I have given 4 stars in the Sound Quality feature but if you change the EQ the sound quality goes up to 5 stars for sure Another rather large issue is that it is currently impossible to use the speaker over Bluetooth with Windows 10 The device will only show up as Unknown device if it even shows up at all and if you manage to connect to it it will indeed name itself to Soundcore Motion but it does not recognize it as an audio device and you cannot use it to play sounds through For me this isn t a huge deal because I use the aux input when using the speaker with my computer but I can image that this issue would impact others rather significantly The other issues I have had are rather minor For example if you have the Volume Sync bluetooth feature enabled you can only change the volume in it s predefined steps so if one notch is too quiet and the next notch up is too loud you just have to deal with it and choose quiet or loud If you disable Volume Sync you can granularly change the volume through the Soundcore app but then the speaker volume is independent of your device volume Another one is that I feel that the rubber stopper that covers the ports has a rather clunky design and while I appreciate that it is rather large to accommodate the waterproof feature I feel like it sticks out quite a lot and gets in the way if you want to use an aux or charge it while you are using it Also I had a very bad experience with the firmware update as it apparently must have at least 50 battery remaining remember it has a rather beefy battery and absolutely did not come anywhere near needing 50 battery I d say 15 20 is a more realistic limit and also apparently takes an exorbitantly long time to update the firmware about 15 minutes to install I had already downloaded the measly 36MB update before it would have made a difference while neglecting to tell you that it is going to take that long until AFTER you have already starting the update and cannot cancel it without risking bricking the thing If I had any warning that it was going to take more than a minute I would have waited until later so I could have used it during my break at work instead of waiting for it to update Now to round it off with a few more good things about the device it turns on quickly and automatically connects to my phone instantly It takes about 3 seconds to turn on and another second or two to connect via bluetooth It also does NOT play any sort of sound when changing or maxing out the volume a feature I absolutely despise in other speakers You can also charge the speaker while using it The Bluetooth 5 0 features are quite nice as well The build quality is fantastic it feels extremely solid and looks like it could take a beating TL DR The speaker is great sounds great and has great battery life but it has a few caveats in the feature functionality such as poor EQ out of the box and a bug causing incompatibility with bluetooth connection to Windows 10 I use this for computer and play from tablet while working This is not a name brand like Bose Bowers or Sonos I have those as well But a better value The reasons are below after using for a while 1 Unlike others the multiple drivers produce stereo sound The expensive brands BT speakers will tell you that it doesn t matter when two speakers are in close proximity But if you are on a desk where the speaker is located you will hear the clear difference a stereo speaker makes You do not need to take the hassle of pairing in TWS fashion 2 Produces clean sound I am not an audiophile but have decent ears being a former musician Even the newer products from the company are falling for market gimmicks to attract customers This is a slightly older model but still better May be you get BT 5 0 instead of 5 3 I could care less 3 You can adjust the sound profile through the app For the things I didn t like the USB and Aux input had a heavy rubberized cover that was unpleasant to move for charging and input It is there for weather protection I get that I cut it off to keep the ports open It stays on my desk not shower A minor thing and not a product fault I love this speaker It has a sleek design so it s not an eye sore It feels extremely durable because it s a little heavier than most portable speakers So if you want something more lightweight then I d go for a different soundcore speaker The sound is great once you change it up in the custom EQ on the soundcore app I think one problem I m having is that it s not staying on the custom EQ when after I turn it off and turn it back on The size is perfect for what I needed And the sound is excellent That being said I am returning it It weighs almost 3 lb and it s just way too heavy Yes the sound is excellent But it s too heavy to carry around with me I just feel like it s weight makes it inconvenient I had an excellent one from Axess that died last month It was slightly larger but the sound was excellent even when I turned it up to blast and it weighed less than a lb It was light and very convenient to take anywhere I would recommend it over this one No star deduction because it does everything as advertised and sounds great doing it but it would be beyond ideal if it had an arc hdmi in put to couple up to my tv instead of the aux input which limits it s interface with the tv For a small tv in a small space it is ideal though I also love jamming my music through it as its volume and sound quality are considerable considering its size This is my first bluetooth speaker I am normally picky about my audio equipment and this has not disappointed We watch movies with it on a laptop Usually with a pair or Vanatoo Transparency Ones It sounds really good for the price It s heavy for it s size but it feels solid and high quality My nitpick is I wish I could figure out how to turn off the on off sound it makes It s probably not annoying to most people but I just like to control sounds on my devices This is easily the best Bluetooth speaker I ve owned The sound quality is incredible When the bass boost is enabled the bass is just about perfect it s pretty underwhelming without the boost I keep it plugged into power most of the time so I can t speak to battery life Bluetooth pairing was a little awkward with my laptop for some reason but that s probably because I didn t read the manual Is it worth the current price 100 If you re looking for something portable with great sound definitely If you re using it as a stationary speaker like I typically do probably not Soundcore Motion is much much better than our JBL Flip 3 it s s good upgrade but it s still not great it s good but not great for 80s hard rock metal and guitar instrumental 80s shreddy stuff but only at low volume levels I rate it 3 5 stars for 80s Hard Rock Metal IMO this is not worth 80 that I paid for it I wish I would have spent a little more for a Bose or Klipsch speaker instead And I would have only paid around 30ish if I knew how it really sounds before I bought it The YouTube videos make it sound much better than it actually sounds in person It sounds much better with Rap music than it does for Rock music I listened to some old school Death Row records Gang Related sound track some Warren G Regulate some DPG Dog Food and some and Daz Dillingers Retaliation Revenge and Get Back these albums are VERY bass heavy and it surprised me on how good it handled the heavy bass I rate it 3 5 5 stars for Rap at low volume The build quality is excellent It s big and heavy and not cheap and light It feels real solid like something that will never break I rate the build quality 5 5 stars 1980s Hi Fi stereos like Sanyo or Fisher had a incredible great sound Klipsch 2 1 speakers for a PC is an incredible great sound But Soundcore Motion isn t even in the same realm of sound quality as those listed above it s good at low volume before it gets muddy at higher volume but it s still only good and not great I had to install a Soundcore app on my phone to get it to connect this rubbed me the wrong way It s stupid and the EQ is overrated and is a joke Overall I give it 3 5 stars and if I could do it over I wouldn t buy this product again I don t hate it or anything like that it s fun to play around with and it does come in handy when I want to use it but it s just not worth the money I paid for it Just like ALL devices with speakers all the tests and YT reviewers all use SIMPLE audio to perform so called tests Providing the devices with the least stress possible This particular device actually does the best for its size with simple audio HOWEVER with complex music such as Classical music or Metal all the smaller devices completely fall apart Why The 2cent answer is because a piece of complex music requires reproduction of almost the entire frequency spectrum at the same time think ALL the instruments at the same time so that when a speaker s suspension is moving to reproduce bass frequencies it ALSO has to reproduce audio from a smaller wave at the center of the speaker sound waves then crash into each other all over the place and this is called DISTORTION The question is does this one At lower volumes this SoundCore motion actually does very well but this IS NOT for blasting in fact I still have yet to come across another product of this size that does this well As far as accuracy of sound again at low volumes it s fantastic at mid volumes it still outperforms everything in its size and price If you like LOUD Complex music there is NOTHING in this size that will do the trick TL version great sound with the companion app to balance the speakers EQ and take advantage of its balanced drivers 100 is an absolute steal for the size just short of the keys section of your keyboard and sound with great dispersion sound stage and bass impact with the EQ tweeked Excellent for a cheap sound bar solution as the voice clarity rivals my center channel speaker absolutely shocking me tbh First let me say i own an absurd amount of bluetooth speakers everything from 20 pharmacy brands to the mega sounding Aiwa Exos9 So when I saw anker get into the speaker game a few years back i figured it wouldn t be great but not bad either For the most part the soundcore line has been that but has made considerable improvements over the years some like the soundcore 2 to 3 jump was not the motion boom to motion boom Very much I held off on the motion this model for a while and ended up getting it on prime day super cheap While my wife wasn t happy to see another speaker sitting around i sure am Without seeming too full of myself lets just say at 40 my hearing is well above that of a normal teenager let alone anyone my age Because of this I ve wedged my way into testing groups and other audio testing my electrical engineering degree doesn t hurt either now on to the motion plus its a unique size to be honest its larger than what the price range would indicate bigger than a bosemini for instance smaller than an aiwa exos 3 but carries a price tag of 100 120 USD which puts it into a questionable scenario based on suspicion alone it has a weight that makes it feel well built and a coating that to me says it doesnt The coating is this rubberish coating that over time does wear out and become smooth ala the soundcore 2 has but its not a turn off i don t expect an aluminum finish for these acoustics or price The buttons are standard it seems on all soundcore speakers up down bluetooth tws multi B button this speaker also sports a Bass UP button that i suggest you never use it resets the EQ sound profiled to Bass up and pressing the button again resets it to original as features go would be nice to see a scrolling EQ when this is pressed even if there is no visual aide to indicate where youre at nitpicking folks at its finest Sound wise this thing shines its frequency range is top to bottom for anyone to hear and the soundstage disperses sound in leveled sweet spots from about 3 feet on a desk about 12 feet out you start to loose the distinction but not the sound this is above average for this sided speaker and i found myself using it more in situations where a smaller speaker wouldn t work During my tests battery life was on par to what is listed as 12 hours although like with all speakers the type and level of listening matters I m tempted to buy another and line them up next to my mid sized go to pick Aiwa s Exos 3 even though that device is larger slightly theres considerable comparisons what might set the motion apart is its forward firing sub driver and open air port in the back which puzzles me as to how it has a reflex port in the rear AND an ipx7 rating you can bet im going to take this apart soon to find out just as soon as i take a break from enjoying the sound of this thing during work final conclusion is pretty straight forward the negatives are few with the battery life being maybe maybe a stretch the only down fall of this speaker simply put you will not find a speaker at one hundred dollars to replicate this sound period probably ever As you can see from the attached pictures I tested a good number of speakers I was in search of a speaker around 100 or less that sounded good and would fit in a suitcase for airplane travel and used indoors in hotel rooms and cruise ship cabins I didn t closely check dimensions and mistakenly bought a few that turned out to be too large for that purpose I was also targeting speakers with aux inputs and power bank capabilities so I would be able to use and simultaneously charge an aptX LL bluetooth receiver This speaker didn t have the power bank functionality but as it turns out I don t need it explained below I have a choosy ear and once equalized with the Soundcore app this Motion speaker sounded better at medium to low volumes than all of the others including the Soundcore Motion Boom and even the larger speakers you see in the pics The sound out of the box was not great The app s equalizer presets were not great either I had to do a custom EQ to get the sound the way I liked it The beauty with these Soundcore products is that the equalizer settings stay with the speaker They are not specific to your phone My only complaint with the app is that you cannot save multiple custom equalizer presets with the Motion like you can when using the app with the Motion Boom Why the interfaces need to be different between the two speakers is beyond me I do believe I noticed a difference with the aptX HD Audio I could enable disable that option in the phone s Bluetooth setting With it on I can hear a little bit more fidelity Of course MP3s and streaming audio are not great sources for testing this sort of thing I still heard a positive difference HUGE BONUS for me that I didn t know about and don t see advertised anywhere on the product page This thing supports aptX LL low latency That must just come with the other Qualcomm aptX stuff I use aptX LL to extend my whole home audio system to dumb speakers I had purchased a tiny aptX LL receiver to plug into this speaker via the aux input but now I don t need it The Motion Boom was a close second sounding better than the rest once equalized but losing to the Motion for my use case The Motion Boom could get a little lower and likely louder not tested but the Motion was punchier and had a better sounding low end overall once equalized I d say the Motion Boom is probably better for outdoor high volume listening I already have a larger less portable outdoor speaker that I m happy with so I returned the Motion Boom I was disappointed that the Motion Boom didn t have an aux input and I thought the soundstage was rather narrow with the treble changing pretty drastically as you walk past the front of the speaker If I needed an outdoor speaker I d definitely be trying out the Motion Boom Plus I can t comment in detail on all of the other speakers I tried but notable contenders were the Tribit XSound Mega which had surprising bass for its size and the W King X 10 which sounds pretty good loud but not so much at lower volumes It s also rather large for a suitcase The rest sounded like crap out of the box to me with little to no low end Some had an app where I may have been able to make them sound better but I did not try I m very happy with this speaker so far This is all I need Great sound at high or low volumes and for TV or music Takes up very little space The EQ and other balance settings are effective and easy to use I ve had this for about 3 weeks Update 8 24 19I have now had this thing for a bit over a week and I can truly say that this is the bestportable speaker I have ever had Battery life is awesome and music is great Thanks Anker Sooo a couple of weeks ago I purchased the Doss Soundbox XL I had been checking out reviews andI really thought that it would be the speaker for me I was really excited to get it in my hands But like finding out your Facebook date looks nothing like the pictures it was a huge let down I knew after the first 3 songs that it was nothing like I thought it would be Very muddy sound and super small sound window It was like having a blanket thrown over it After trying everything I could to fix it I finally sent it back As soon as I got the refund I ordered this the Anker Soundcore Motion and waited impatientlyfor it to arrive and have now had it for a bit over 8 hours I remember when I opened the Doss I was really surprised at how big it was almost awkward This was not the case with this speaker Very nice package and a good weight to it This thing is simplicity in it s self Buttons are easy to find just a momentary push on the powerbutton turns it on and into pairing mode It starts in base up mode which was fine for me Played my first song Big smile oh yea Clear highs very tight base that was clear and robust Very nice sound stage So I did the same thing as I did with the Doss I took it all over the houseto hear how it sounds Corners make this thing come alive It truly is where this speaker wants to live One thing I learned was that this speaker comes with the ability to play aptx and that Android8 0 or above has this option This is a Bluetooth tech that allows the music to sound as much likeCD quality as possible using Bluetooth Bluetooth data has to be compressed to send to the speakerand usually that causes sound quality issues But this tech aims to fix this and seems to really work well I then took this speaker with me to a building I m working on and it s empty right now It s a big100 x 100 building It has a few small 8 corners along the front of the building and I made that it shome Kicked up some tunes and got to work All I can say is this thing simply blows me away in it sability to project good sound even in such a large empty area Of course once I started using equipmentit cannot compete but dang I would walk out and back into the building and it just sounded awesome So now for the only thing I don t like and the only reason I gave it four stars The app Now the app it s self is not really the issue at all It s the privacy agreementand all the things they make you allow to use it It s off the charts If you care anythingat all about your privacy then this app is a no go And this is where things get ugly See you cannot update the firmware without the app So in order to update the speakersfirmware I have to accept some very ugly privacy conditions that I simply cannot agree to Sadly most people don t even read these anymore They just click and play No thought aboutall the stuff that is being sent to Anker in the background And not just Anker but all their affiliates This is like a huge spiderweb of companies that we know nothing about To get past this I just installed it and then after getting the update I just uninstalled it It s weird some of their speakers can be upgraded on your pc but this one cannot So Anker please if you read any of these reviews fix this so we can at least update the speakeron our computers at home without having to accept and agree to terms we don t like Honestly I should not have to allow you to have all that information just to use a equalizer and updater So besides that one issue this thing rocks like no tomorrow on virtually anything I played on it And will be my go to portable speaker for as long as the thing will play Thanks again to Oluv s Gadgets for reviewing this great speaker I should have trusted your judgementin the first place Enjoy Full disclosure I am a musician and recording professional so I may be a bit more critical or discerning than the average consumer That said I hope this review will help anyone else on a similar quest I was on the search for a pair of bluetooth speakers to connect in stereo for use in our yard or home I purchased 2 JBL Xtreme first edition at 150 a piece so 300 for the pair I had issues with connectivity and could only use them if they were within 5 feet of each other The sound was decent and plenty loud but too hyped up in the bass They made a lot of songs sound muffled or too boomy The JBL app has no options for EQ so you re basically stuck with what you get if you want to use multiple devices to connect I then looked around and found some great reviews on these Motion speakers and liked the price point plus the fact that I could use a custom EQ They also use bluetooth 5 0 so I thought it would be better for connectivity So I ordered 2 Turns out stereo connectivity was only better by about a foot or two Same issue as the JBLs Dang I guess that s just what you get when pairing multiple speakers I live in Portland OR so we are not rural but our yard is a half acre and I didn t think I d have this much of a problem with interference Funny how speaker manufacturers all advertise up to 30 feet but have a disclaimer about it depending on other mysterious factors Like living in city The custom EQ was nice for the motion plus speakers but with some caveats First off you are starting with a sound that is so boxy and mid focused I just wonder what the heck they were thinking With the default EQ setting these were absolutely horrible sounding By cutting some mids I was able to get a decent sound posted a picture of my settings but still a bit boxy The problem is in stereo mode only the master speaker changes with the EQ This led to a lot of fiddling with connecting and disconnecting the individual speakers to try to get each one EQ d the same as the other After tons of back and forth I was able to get them sounding decent I found cutting mids reduced the volume output but sounded better than boosting low and high frequencies The real problems came about when the Bluetooth connection started get really strange Volume fluctuations and skipping like a cd that s scratched I had to leave my phone right next to the speaker to resolve the issue but at about 10 or 15 feet away with no obstructions there was definitely issues I returned these after that as the whole point was to have music filling up our large back yard with a decent sound but have the phone on my person to be able to DJ tracks I went to best buy today to try out some other options I figured one bigger speaker would be a better solution at this point The Ultimate Ears Hyperboom won by a mile That speaker is amazing sounding Not sure why Amazon doesn t sell these new but for 399 that speaker kills the competition My search is over I just ordered one direct from UE I feel bad for buying and returning speakers but hopefully this review will help someone else who is looking for the best sound for indoor and outdoor use The bose pro system also sounded great but at 600 it wasn t much better than the UE hyperboom and with no 360 sound I d need two and I am definitely not willing to part with 1200 at this point and I want a more portable option as well Good luck all you music lovers and I highly recommend that JBL and Anker Soundcore look into making something that will compete with UE s Hyperboom That speaker kills the JBL Boombox and the JBL partybox lineup just sounds loud No balanced sound just loud Sony s lineup also sounded decent but a little lacking comparatively If you re like me and like to hear feel the sub frequencies the Hyperboom is a clear winner JBL boombox is next in line but my wife hated the look of it Long review here but I saw there is a shortage of detailed and technical reviews for what I was looking to get which is a big sound in an indoor outdoor portable bluetooth speaker for a reasonable price I was looking for something beefier than my Oontz 3 Ultra not that I was ever really unhappy with that critter It s just that when you wanna win in the ring sometime s you gotta go with a mid weight fighter not the light weight I will admit that I m a bit of a snob when it comes to bass If I can t hear it or feel it I m left feeling empty Especially at a lower volume setting And that s where the Oontz 3 disappointed me Not so much with my new Anker Soundcore Motion Plus I know I know it s not even really fair to compare the two because they shouldn t be in the same ring throwing punches at each other All I m saying is that if you want a bigger punch with all of the flair included I suggest the Anker option Bear in mind however that if you decide on the Motion you will surrender a round or two on the scoring card of portability Anker s Motion is heavier and much larger It still fits into my bookbag and laptop carrier okay but there is a noticeable difference when trying to make room for it and especially when lugging the bags around With all this being said I love this new ANKER speaker And I don t see myself ever going back to an Oontz Ultra But please remember that I am extremely picky when it comes to hearing AND feeling my music If you re in the same boat as I am Let the Anker be your new anchor It ll keep you grounded in your music for sure I put this up for comparison vs my first generation JBL Xtreme and also the first generation Bose Soundlink Mini Keep in mind that the Soundlink Mini is a smaller speaker and isn t necessarily in the same league but price wise it is Volume JBL Xtreme takes it Soundcore Motion comes in close second Bose Soundlink Mini hard thirdSound quality Both the JBL Xtreme and Bose Soundlink Mini had a clear emphasis on bass to the point where unless you used a third party equalizer it could get pretty muddy at times Neither distorted at high volumes but the DSP definitely showed it s limits For a party you might not really care but for focused listening you ll notice it for sure I believe that the Xtreme while rated at 40W output only gives 20W when played unplugged but I could be wrong Soundlink Mini has no wattage output as Bose generally doesn t provide that Soundcore Motion has both speakers beat here it s got a relatively flat DSP and the app does have an equalizer that you can customize Whether plugged in or not it supposedly outputs it s full 30W There s clear stereo separation on this speaker as well and I think but am not sure that the JBL Xtreme has two tweeters as well For this I d go Soundcore Motion first JBL Xtreme second and Bose Soundlink Mini third Size Portability JBL Xtreme is the largest but comes with straps Soundcore Motion is second with no case straps and SoundLink Mini is smallest with optional cases The Motion is actually pretty easy to transport in my gym bag and I definitely don t notice it there as much as the Xtreme I d go with the Motion for best overall portability Inputs All three speakers have bluetooth AUX inputs and the Xtreme takes it one step further with USB inputs by sheer number of options JBL Xtreme is first followed by the Soundcore Motion as it has BT 5 0 USB C and Soundlink Mini last Weather Proofing JBL Xtreme and Soundcore are more or less tied here waterproof resistant dust proof resistant have sealed flaps for the ports while the Soundlink is meant for dry temperate use only Battery Life Considering I ve owned the Xtreme and the Soundlink Mini since they came out their batteries have definitely deteriorated so they don t get the same amount of hours they used to get I d say that the Xtreme at it s peak gave me about 8 hours and the Soundlink about 6 8 as well Motion is rated for 12 hours and I ve been getting about 10 12 hours Motion first Xtreme second Soundlink third Charging Both the Xtreme and Soundlink have their own proprietary chargers which can be incredibly inconvenient Motion charges via USB C and can be charged with some higher powered portable battery packs as well as wall warts which make it the clear winner The Xtreme does have the added benefit of providing power through it s USB ports which is handy in a pinch You could attach something like the Moto Stream and run it off the Xtreme s battery while playing via AUX to have a better party speaker which is kinda neat Motion first Xtreme and Soundlink tied with the Xtreme having a slight edge on being able to power other devices as well App Support Bonus or negative depending on your view Bose doesn t have an app for it s first generation speaker so it s not considered JBL s app is relatively simple but doesn t provide any EQ for it s Xtreme You can link another speaker to it so long as it s supported by it s proprietary Connect connection note it does NOT work with Connect speakers so you can t connect the Xtreme to the Xtreme2 which is a bummer Soundcore app is simple as well but includes a customizable EQ and allows for your speakers to connect to other Soundcore speakers Overall I d give it to the Soundcore Motion for it s customizable EQ To me the contest is clearly between the Xtreme and the Motion the Soundlink just doesn t compare despite being priced similarly I d say the best overall speaker around this price range is definitely the Motion it covers all of it s bases nicely and can match the Xtreme in enough categories while sounding better If you can get this speaker for sub 90 then you got yourself a deal This is a solid unit with good sound and surprisingly crisp bass I had a problem and customer service went above and beyond to make it right Title says it all I ve used cheaper more expensive and this is the best all around for my purposes Great sound tight punchy bass that isn t overwhelming and clear articulate highs with mids that offer clarity but not any of that wooly quality you can sometimes get My favorite Bluetooth speaker I upgraded from a different brand that I had bought 3 years ago and wow the technology of this speaker blows the old one out of the water Very clear high notes great middle and strong bass In this price range this is a must buy I bought this speaker after my tribit 20 to 30 dollar speakers died so I ll compare the anker with the tribit speaker The anker is significantly louder bigger and heavier It has a led on the power button that is white when it s on or red when it is low on battery power When you turn it on It plays the usual anker jingle when powered on and off if you own any of their earbuds and headphones What I like it gets loud and it s clear The bass is not feel it in your chest but it s pretty good better than the tribit for sure I like the buttons on top they are big and easy to press The overall materials and heft to it just gives the impression of durability and good build quality I also like how thick and big the rubber protector is on the usb c and output connectors section Of course it s a usb c charging format The middle of the road things My tribit speaker lasted about 24 hours before needing to charge but would take 8 hours or more to charge This one lasts for about 12 hours haven t really tested it but seems about right plus or minus However it takes usually 2 to 4 hours to charge back up so take note of that It s not plug and play I ll get into that in cons Power button is smaller than the tribit and located on the side and not as easy to press What I don t like The bass button and feature is doodoo It basically is there to make the default settings better which it does However the default sound settings are horrible This is not I repeat not open up the box charge and play You really need the soundcore app for this bad boy It s vital that you go into the app and use the equalizer to make it sound good Don t use the preset modes they are pretty bad too there is an issue with that too If you own any earbuds or headphones there are options to have multiple eq profiles that you created that you can switch between This has 1 so you cannot switch between profiles depending on what your listening to which is perplexing to say the least The other thing I don t like is the price my tribit cost me 20 to 30 bucks This shouldn t cost 100 bucks or 90 bucks at all This should cost 60 to 75 bucks max regular price It s louder yes but it really doesn t improve battery life it s not plug and play and I don t care much about setting it up but just 1 eq profile Really In conclusion is it good Yes Does it have stupid cons Yes is it worth full price hell no Should you buy it Hell yea but only if on sale not full price I bought this particular brand model at the recommendation of a friend for use in my classroom after having borrowed his one too many times All students can hear it perfectly well in every corner of my teaching space and no one is blasted out of the room when used at high volume Overall loudness is probably not great for parties but it s just right for our needs I do have to check it for a charge each time I want to use it but I have developed that habit This speaker sounds great and really fills a room The bass is deep and punchy a lot more than you d expect from the size Sounds especially good when you play lossless or high rez audio and it even supports spatial audio You can crank it up and there s no distortion even on max volume Feels sturdy and well built At this price I was skeptical but this blows the more expensive JBL Charge 5 and Bose SoundLink Flex out of the water I wanted a speaker system I could throw up on a shelf in my large 30 x50 garage I wanted to have it powered with a cord and I didn t want to have to turn it on by pushing a button every time I wanted to use it It is so hard to find something that checks those boxes but this does I have it sitting on a piece of wood on an old drill press in the corner about 8 in the air 16 ceilings I have a usb c cord plugged into a wall adapter and into the speaker and I just leave it on all the time When i m going to work in my garage I just open up blue tooth on my phone connect to the speaker and open up pandora and i m good to go With the volume all the way up it is pretty damn loud i normally have the volume around 80 and even if i m welding or grinding i can usually still hear it just fine Awesome speaker The only thing I dont like about it is I left it somewhere and lost it So buying another very specially for the price The Motion is a very good speaker at this price range To get the best out of it look around on the internet for some EQ recommendations to start with Keep in mind that every firmware update can affect the sound quality I honestly wasn t that impressed with this speaker out of the box I got it dialed in much better by using the EQ in the Soundcore app but there are still some frequencies that are overboosted that I can t tune out with the EQ and since I am using an IOS device Apple doesn t give me anything that will work with Amazon Music Out out of the box I d give it a 5 10 for its size Dialed in I d say closer to 8 10 I bought the EarFun Bluetooth Speaker UBOOM L at the same time Basically no EQ options for it as it doesn t have an app You can choose sound modes which are for indoor or outdoor which seems to accentuate or attenuate the bass a bit Out of the box this speaker sounded far better than the Motion Even with the Motion dialed in the best I could with the EQ the Uboom sounds better I d give it an 8 5 or 9 10 The best I ve tried in this size group has to be the JBL Charge 5 WiFi It costs twice as much as the Motion or Uboom but I caught it on sale and it was very close in price to the Motion It also has the best battery life of the 3 The Motion is a good option The bass lacks compared to the other 2 I ve mentioned but mids and highs are pretty good but there is a sort of a peak around 5k that makes it a bit shrill The other 2 seem to extend better into the bass area I d give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars It is clearly one of the best in this size group I d put it a 3 cost no object I d put it at 2 if cost is an object The Uboom is 2 for best sound independent of price and 1 if cost is a significant driver Best sound is JBL Charge 5 WiFi by a nose so 1 here I d put it 3 if cost is very important If you can catch it on sale It would be a tough decision between it and the Uboom Speaker sounds great battery life not so hot I can t make it through a 8hrs before it needs charged The bass on this mighty little beast is amazing Definitely the best portable speaker I ve ever had Anker has always been my go to for charging cables and charger cubes now adding speakers to that list I am a totally addicted to Bluetooth speakers and to quality sound For the most part you get what you pay for when you buy speakers In the attached picture you will see a lot of speakers There are pros and cons to each one and each one serves a purpose Here is some of what I ve found on each one Aiwa Exos 9 This is a great speaker for a party or for camping It is 200 watts and has an equalizer so that you can get the sound just like you want it It is very loud but will distort when you turn it all the way up It is too large and usually unpractical for most situations Harmon Kardon Go Play 2 I like this speaker for indoor use It is 100 watts and has some deep low end sound It is heavy and pretty large The main thing I don t like is that the battery won t last more than about 2 hours when you listen to it at a decent volume Logitech Boombox I have two of these and they were my go to speaker for about 5 6 years The sound is very close to the Anker Soundcore Motion but these are quite a bit bigger Also I think the Anker Soundcore sounds a little better due to the equalizer on the Soundcore JBL Xtreme version 1 This is currently one of my favorite speakers I use it for listening to music on the beach or around the pool It has more pronounced bass than the Xtreme 2 It sounds great and has no distortion at full volume and it gets loud The Anker actually gets very close to as loud but the Xtreme maintains its bass at it s highest volume and the Anker loses some of it s thump at full volume Anker Soundcore Motion This is also one on my favorite speakers I love both the equalize and the volume It does not distort at full volume but does lose some bass It sounds much larger than it s size which means you get a very portable loud speaker with great sound I am so impressed with how much power this smaller speaker delivers It is very versatile and will work for almost any occasion Bose Soundlink Mini II This speaker is amazing for its size It is great at lower volumes for listening at home or around a pool It s portability is hard to beat and it puts out amazing bass for its size It just doesn t shine when you turn it up as it loses almost all of it s bass when you go past 60 70 percent volume JBL Flip version 1 At one time this speaker was considered amazing It is loud for it s size These days I m sure the newer versions are much better when it comes to sound quality I use this speaker for white noise when I am staying at a hotel or on vacation Overall my new favorite speakers are the JBL Xtreme and the Anker Soundcore Motion They are both amazing and the JBL is slightly more powerful The Anker s size weight equalizer and power make it more portable convenient for most listening situations In all of my years of buying speakers and I own a lot more than just the ones in this pic I haven t found a better value for the money Even if you don t get it at the discounted price it is huge bargain If you re on the fence go for it You won t regret it I was actually looking to buying similarly sized JBL speaker in my local shop Luckily done my research before doing that JBL no aux very basic BT format SBC rudimentary app well extended and slightly uneven FR sounds ok in person besides weird grain somewhere in highs around 10Hz better bass extension Price is 3X Motion Plus AptX HD and low latency mode aux in which I use a lot can be connected to both my and my gf phones at the same time 9 band EQ a bit smaller than JBL fits my hand well wide sound dispersion ok and easy to EQ stock sound and all that while being 70 80 bucks No brainer Sound Sine sweeps by ear subjectively correlate with dips and peaks in RTings measurement from 400Hz and up Some of FR unevenness can be addressed by EQ in Anker s app though 4 6 band parametric EQ will solve all the major issues EQ preset on my screenshot is made on the base of BassUP preset to make the stock FR closer to flat Removes shouty peak at around 3KHz zingy peak at approx 5KHz fills in some lower treble and air Values in Db differ from what may appear reasonable by RTings graph they re adjusted accordingly to my subjective perception during sine sweep runs for instance I pushed 2 5KHz down lower then it supposed to be accordingly to graph You can easily adjust value in Db to flatten FR accordingly to RTings graph Stereo mode It exists it works and it is very easy to setup which is awesome I wasn t testing it thoroughly but in my case there is a delay in starting the playback so first couple of seconds of song are omitted Since stock frequency response is still very decent app is great and price is low motion plus makes a great gift Just bought third Great job Soundcore I originally purchased this Soundcore Motion more than a year ago and once I customized the EQ via the Soundcore app I was super impressed with the sound quality I never would have expected such comparatively impressive bass in conjunction with crisp non shrill highs from such a small enclosure It has been a joy to use After reading of how terrific these speakers sound when joined in pairs for the full left right stereo effect I purchased another from Amazon yesterday Alas after going through the pairing directions multiple times I had no success in pairing the two speakers In my research to find out the cause of the problem I followed Anker s posted instructions on how to reset the speakers delete the pairings from my phone etc but no luck I then happened upon a post in Anker Community forum where the person had two speakers with two different firmware revisions and they submitted a ticket to Anker to find out if the pairing should still work Anker responded that no in fact it won t When I doubled checked my speakers my older speaker FCC ID ending in A3116 had a firmware revision of 45 xx while the new one FCC ID ending in A3116J has a revision of 75 xx so that is my issue It is unclear if Anker would be able to update my older speaker s firmware at some point to match the new one or if hardware enhancements might prevent this Presently though I am unable to make use of stereo pairing of the two speakers which is the entire reason I purchased the second Motion Edit I reached out to Anker support with this question and they promptly responded that yes this is the case the two versions actually contain different chipsets and they will NOT pair with one another Edit I originally knocked off one star for this issue but I have now added it back as I purchased another of the newer version speakers and it pairs effortlessly with its twin I will gift the older version to someone since I don t need three units They all sound wonderful though I would prefer that Anker make some distinction as to the different revisions of this product and perhaps add a disclaimer about the pairing issue between different versions If not Anker then perhaps Amazon could take the initiative and edit the item description Should potentional buyers want to be able to take advantage of the stereo pairing feature particularly if they already have a Motion I would recommend buying them in pairs to maximize the chances of getting the same hardware revision and firmware Overall though it s a fantastic little speaker with wonderful sound quality and sufficient battery life for my needs and I would highly recommend it I know a lot about and own several Bluetooth speakers I own I think the largest party speaker that Anker makes the Rave which is a very excellent product I also own a W King also a very excellent product I was using my W King on my nightstand about 2 feet from my head I had acquired a desire to upgrade the W King with something perhaps more elegant and smaller and less utility looking Eureka I happened upon this heavenly creature of a Bluetooth speaker The W King currently costing 75 dollars is still the best bang for 75 If You are not so poor that you can t squeeze another 25 dollars out of your wallet I very strongly suggest that you pull those rubber bands from around you wallet let those moths escape and kerplunk down 100 and buy this box instead I used my W King as a reference point in my quest to hopefully replace it The Motion is half the size of the W King and sexy It has the build quality and appearance of an Apple product Dr Dre Pill on illegal steroids Hold on to your hat although smaller this thing plays louder and clearer than the W King I mean actually If I had not myself purchased this and blindfold tested this I would swear that I was hearing a Bose Wave CD player I had considered buying a second Motion but decided not to Unless you have to realize the added dimension of stereo you d be make something that sounds really good sound really good and loud I don t need that in my life A second one of these would be a waste of money as you would always be listening to the two at a low volume setting Two of these could work out for you if you throw parties Your guests would be wondering where is he hiding his towers and subwoofer Thank You Anker This is a revision to my prior review I previously stated that owning two of these would be a waste of money At this time I would like to retract that statement as nonsense I took the plunge and bought a second Motion My position on the matter now is that two of these make something that sounds good sound better probably something to do with increased power bandwidth using two I have these installed on either side of my headboard I sleep literally bathed in hi fi I sometimes sit on the other side of the room astounded that that sound is coming from those tiny drivers and passive radiators A coup de gras for Anker research development and engineering However I should point out as some other reviewers have there is a problem sometimes with bluetooth connectivity I choose to call this phenomenon line of sight radio wave interference If you learn to live with this system the problem will loom as minuscule Also some reviewers have complained about the sound quality I could only imagine that these people do not or don t know how to use the included Soundcore equalizer With this and any audio system a graphic equalizer is essential to optimize performance and sound quality Using Anker s or any good equalizer app plugin I can find nothing wrong with the sound of this box What doe s anyone require from a box that s 9 5 by 3 inches and cost one hundred dollars and has a battery and is portable and fits in your pocket if you wear a big coat Thank you Anker Incredible battery life Deep bass and plenty of volume Easy to connect I can t say enough good things about this I use it daily for music anything else I m playing on my phone or laptop Took it to a hotel it filled the room at around half volume Bass clarity are top notch Also more than one device can connect to it at once I have to say as far as bluetooth speakers go I ve always been a big JBL fan I ve had a JBL Xtreme Flip 3 Flip 4 Clip 2 and Clip 3 Recently my Flip 4 battery began to die so I started researching replacements My natural inclination was to get a Flip 5 which I did order from Amazon and eventually used for a comparison with the Motion I watched a bunch of You Tube video comparisons each proclaiming how good the Motion is I also read a ton of comments on Amazon so I decided to order it This thing is unbelievable for a 100 speaker I have to say I was a bit skeptical but it really lives up to all the positive ratings and comments Based on the sound comparison with a Flip 5 which may or may not really be fair it blew the Flip 5 away Probably a JBL Charge 4 or 5 would be a more fair comparison but I don t have one so I can only speak to what I could actually compare What I noticed 1 Clarity incredible clarity even at high volumes At around 75 80 JBL began to lose some clarity Motion was still clear as a bell 2 Stereo JBL doesn t to my knowledge have any true stereo speakers Motion actually plays in stereo yea 3 Amazing bass for its size It s not going to give you the same level of bass as say a Bose S1 Pro which I also have but you can t expect that it will However for its size the bass is punchy deep and clear Make sure to use the bass boost function 4 There s an equalizer app available for Android or iPhone What a nice feature 5 Other nice features IPX7 water resistant and rugged shell just like JBL If you re looking for new speaker or even your first one definitely at least give the Motion a try UPDATE I recently got my hands on a Bose Soundlink Color II and did a sound comparison The Motion blew the Bose out of the water I m always tempted to try something new and see if it beats the Motion but so far nothing near this price can compare Another comparison I tried the Motion against the new Bose Soundlink Flex While the actual sound of the Bose was superior and had some nice punchy bass the Motion was louder and still held its own to the Bose Morion wins it for outdoor use for sheer volume I do think the Bose Flex wins for sound clarity and smoothness and would probably be better for indoor use Update 7 23 2024 I just ordered another Soundcore Motion to pair two of them together I m very disappointed that you cannot pair on older version Motion with the new version Soundcore please fix this In the meantime I m sending the new one back My old one is still going strong after 3 years My nearly 20 year old Bose Sounddock finally died and I was looking for replacement with good sound and small size The Anker Soundcore Motion Plus has been a great replacement I believe the sound is equal to my old Bose I had purchased a small Soundcore 2 several years ago for use on my patio and travel and was very impressed with the sound This Soundcore Motion Plus has an even more solid bass and clear treble and is a perfect size for our small living room The bass boost is solid and with 30W of power should fill most spaces with thundering volume Two devices can be linked for a true stereo effect but for a small room the sound experience with a single unit is excellent The device is water and splash resistant for outdoor use but gives piece of mind for use in my living room where spills from cats and grandkids are possible or if I wanted to take it to the kitchen It would also be perfect for use at your cabin or on your deck or patio The exterior does have a rubber like coating but comes in several colors that look fine for your indoor spaces There are a couple of small issues Because it is battery powered you will have to physically turn it on to use it Battery life is quite long but It will turn off automatically when not in use with an auto shut off feature that can be adjusted via a phone or tablet app It would have been ideal to have it turn on via the phone app or through an Alexa voice app The manual that ships with the device is useless pictograms Fortunately I was able to find a written owners manual online and one is available with the phone app The equalizer on the phone app only allows you to turn the bass boost on or off It would have been nice to have actual equalizer controls over a range of frequencies or preset equalizations for music or room type However both my Android phone and an Alexa app have equalizer features Aside from the pictogram quick guide set up was easy and the Bluetooth sync was without problems for both my phone and Alexa The app also allows for firmware updates but also includes push notifications The device also supports the latest Bluetooth codex though your connected devices may not offer that higher standard e g generation 1 and 2 Alexa devices The speaker can however be directly connected with aux line in with an included cable Overall the Anker Soundcore Motion Plus was exactly what I was looking for and at the price I wanted to pay Given my good experience with my Anker Soundcore 2 speaker I would expect this product to be equally trouble free This unit has good sound for the size and price I would prefer that the buttons on the top be in a more contrasting color It is black on black and hard to see Otherwise I can t complain Has an external jack for if you want to plug something into it like a television That is an addition to the blue Good company with a good reputation I have been using the Anker Soundcore 2 for years While that is perfectly acceptable for listening to podcasts indoors the sound quality is lacking for music And it s not loud enough to use outdoors without significant distortion In the last year I ve shifted back towards more music listening and needed a speaker upgrade There are a ton of options and you could spend a lot more money if you wanted the absolute best sound quality The reviews for the Soundcore Motion were generally good to very good so I took a chance because I ve had a great track record with Anker products The other options I considered were the JBL Flip 6 JBL Charge 5 Ultimate Ears Boom 3 and Bose SoundLink Flex I m listing these for reference to the price range quality and size I was looking at before purchasing the Soundcore Motion Pros Overall excellent sound quality I have never been one to buy the best quality speakers but this sounds significantly better than the small speakers I ve gathered over the years and probably better than my Subaru Crosstrek Sport 2021 It is not as good as my old school Aiwa and Sharp 3 piece stereo boomboxes but it s pretty close For reference I mostly listen to metal and rap and I judge sound quality on how my favorite metal bands sound on different speakers The form factor is rock solid and sits flat It s going to be more stable than other options that are more cylindrical and especially the speakers that sit upright Directional speakers over the wraparound style I want a speaker that directs sound towards me and doesn t fill the room especially at work Battery life is excellent It is listed as 12 hours but I think it s quite a bit more Technology websites have tested it being closer to 16 hours USB C charging and Aux ports These days it s hard to find Aux ports on speakers If you have an old iPod like me then it s nice to have that Aux option Cons Heavy and bulky compared to other options in this price range I have no problem grabbing the Soundcore 2 to move it around the house or between labs and offices at work but the weight of this makes me think twice about casually grabbing it Charging is slow longer than I m used to with the Soundcore 2 and other small electronic devices Minor quibble I wish all of the buttons are a little bigger It s a solid speaker with wonderful battery life It s not a premium product so don t expect all the bells and whistles but the app is wonderful for customising the sound to your liking Pro 1 Easy set up with iPhone 1 min 2 Deep rich sound3 I love the soundcore app with various eq options to appease your personal tastes also easy set up 4 Built very solid love the rubberized material choice on top and bottom easy grip 5 Apparently Anker offers customer support 24 7 did a ton of research before deciding on the motion and I feel I made a great choiceCons1 As of right now I don t have anything negative to add I am admittedly and audiophile very particular about equipment and sound I will update my review in a month to let you know how it s going UPDATE 05 26 21I HIGHLY recommend getting the free Soundcore App for adjusting the EQ as it makes a huge difference The speaker is very responsive and much improved with the App EQ If you aren t savvy with the EQ there are a few sound maniacs on YouTube that can walk you through how they have it set up and they are great I really have enjoyed this speaker I did a blind sound comparison between my new Apple HomePod and my Soundcore Motion with my wife a couple of buddies and myself They both excell at different things highs mids lows but the overall SQ between the Motion and HomePod was pretty much a toss up Also convenience wise the Motion beats the Apple on several fronts and I have an iPhone LOL Keep in mind the the HomePod is 300 and the Motion is 100 Im liking the Motion so much that I ordered another one and paired them together I tried to do this on my own but couldn t quite figure it out I called customer service and a rep answered my call right away was very professional and walked me through it As much as I enjoyed the 1 speaker having 2 of them synced together sounds VERY VERY VERY nice I enjoy this set up so much that I decided to return my Apple HomePod I have nothing negative to say about this Soundcore Motion Plus Get it get the app and if you have 200 to buy 2 of them DO IT You ll be quite blown away with the SQ for 200 If you don t have the cash for two one Motion is plenty good for most people Again I m a bit of one of those sound maniacs or audiophiles I ll just throw one more thing in the build quality on these guys are SOLID I m a very happy customer I buy a lot of shizzle on Amazon This speaker and my awesome Leaf Blower has nothing to do with Anker Soundcore are the best things I ve purchased on Amazon EVER Regards I purchased this in April 2022 It s now October 2023 This used to be my daily driver for all things home audio at home until I purchased the SoundCore Motion x600 in May 2023 I love that Once I got stuck on that this kind of got stuck on a shelf Back then the battery life was acceptable but I don t think it was ever near 12hours like advertised Maybe half that maybe a bit less Not a biggie However in my attempts to have one bluetooth device for each PC phone that played audio to avoid the struggles of trying to determine which device was taking over which bluetooth device I started using this again Battery life now is about non existent I don t have exact figures but I expect it s easily within an hour it dies if not plugged in when in use I basically have to leave it plugged in which works for its use case but not ideal I have a lot of Anker products in my shopping history here going back almost 10 years A large number of those products are in use today still Possibly I got a dud here It s a solid bluetooth speaker and while I d usually go with Anker over other brands in a number of categories certainly against others in the same price range I m not sure I d get this particular speaker again as good as it sounds I ve had this speaker for a little over a year now In almost all respects I have been very impressed Unfortunately the Bluetooth range or lack thereof is a serious flaw The good The sound quality is amazing for such a small speaker I never would have expected such a rich bass from a speaker this size The Soundcore app allows me to customize the EQ for my tastes This allows me get the most out of the small speaker without washing out the overall sound with pure volume Charging portability and durability are all right where they should be Again very impressed by the quality The bad The Bluetooth range is appallingly limited I have connected the speaker to multiple iPhones Most of my Bluetooth devices can maintain a solid connection well over 20 yards especially if the devices are within line of sight This speaker however will start to drop a Bluetooth connection in less than 5 yards even without obstacles in the way It is a serious flaw There is no point in having a Bluetooth connection if the phone needs to be that close to the speaker I might as well buy a 3 5mm cable and just hardwire the connection If you want to use the speaker during a backyard cookout that s fine But you ll have to leave your phone sitting right next to the speaker instead of in your pocket as you walk around Again it s a great speaker but the short Bluetooth range is a serious flaw ____UPDATE after another 6 months When connected to the charger it may not be able to draw enough power to function at higher volumes I used it at a party recently and I had to keep the volume at maximum or close to it The battery died after about 3 hours no surprise there I hooked up the charging cable and turned it back on Every 10 to 15 minutes it would die again I m assuming that at full volume it uses more power than it can draw through the charging cable This is very disappointing This is the only time I have used it on max volume for extended times and the only time I have used it hardwired to the charger But it should be able to draw power consistently enough to function For what it s worth even at the high volumes the sound quality was still impressive The bass was a little lacking but it s still impressive The bluetooth range is still appalling It s also inconsistent I actually got it to connect at around 20 yards the other day But it would randomly crackle out or drop the connection Again I eventually just placed my phone right next to the speaker Sound quality and volume are excellent in these portable wireless Bluetooth connected Anker speakers Very little distortion at higher levels I had a few connectivity issues until I got the hang of it but everything is jake now I had a pair of the equivalent 99 Bose wireless portable speakers and returned them for these Anker vs Bose comparison Sound is superior in Anker speaker Bose does offer the choice of mono or stereo sound App needed to pair Bose speakers No app needed to pair Anker speakers Once Anker speakers are paired they stay paired when you turn the speakers on again No need to re pair as with Bose Anker has an equalizer function to customize music Stays at the setting when turned on again When the Anker speakers are paired when you turn one off the other shuts off as well Bose speakers must be shut off individually When music is paused the Anker speakers stayed powered up for much longer than the Bose speakers roughly 20 vs 5 minutes With the Bose I always felt that if I left the room for a couple of minutes I had to open the app again and re pair the speakers One item to note when I first got the Anker speakers some songs started half a second into the song intro a semi annoying problem I once had with a pair of earbuds However that issue seems to have resolved itself The sound between the Anker speakers will drift from time to time That is sound will fade in one of the speakers and increase in the other for a second or two before equalizing again Happens occasionally and is not annoying enough to put me off the speakers I would have preferred a vertical rather than a horizontal orientation but the Anker speakers are very solid and portable I love to move them around the room so that no matter where I am I am perfectly between the two speakers There s something about the speakers that make the music very comfortable almost soothing to the ears I I never want to turn them off I had a pair of the equivalent Bose speakers and returned them for these A friend of mine did the exact opposite but that s because she wanted the mono sound option in the Bose Some people think it s better for parties because no matter where you are in relation to the speaker you can hear all the instruments in the song I am very happy to give these Anker speakers two enthusiastic thumbs up After some faithful years my JBL Charge 3 has fizzeled out Resorting to being on the charger to work Reddit actually led me to find this speaker Pros Budget As it was on Sale for 85 versus a charge 5 at roughly 160 and everything else far above thatSound with tweaking The audio out this thing is amazing Not life changing Not ridiculous But as someone who primarily listens to hip hop jazz and r b this speaker in it s 6 8 hours of usage already has blown me away It gets loud It has crisp bass decent mids and pretty clear highs For the price range this is what I ve come to expect and it has matched expectationsPairing By holding Bluetooth you can pair two of these speakers together and this naturally offers double the amazing sound and you can truly fill a bedroom with music I d compare the experience to having a massive soundbar like an entire walls length with a mini subwoofer It s actually an incredibly immersive experience And once again the price of this thing means buying two might not hurt your bank terriblyVolume Even with a singular speaker I can easily fill my bedroom with more than enough sound In a masterbedroom half the room is drowned with music and the other is conversation level Cons Battery The battery at 75 100 volume will die at roughly 4 6 hours I ve had two sessions on one battery session right out the box before resorting to charge That s not terrible to be honest but worth mentioning as a conMax Volume Sound You are going to sacrifice some quality of sound as you increase volume pass 75 80 I don t notice distortions but the bass actually gets outpowered by mids and highs which slap out for lack of better terms I do find this problem remedied with pairing two speakers and having them on opposite ends of the roomOverall I look forward to seeing how long this speaker lasts me First impressions are strong I am happy for now The battery is a minor con for the overall quality of the products sound Make sure to download the Soundcore application and check reviews for your personal custom tweaking This is completely unpaid just decided to write because Anker has never disappointed in my household Easy 8 9 10 product If it lasts the years this should easily be your go to 10 10 portable Bluetooth speaker But only time will tell that for now Speaker is quality made and sounds great Nice and loud with great quality Bluetooth range is average but not great I d needed a speaker to replace my 6 year old Douni which had a weird farting sound when the bass hits above 27 volume After thousands of hours of speaker reviews I settled on this one So far I m not regretting the extra 20 watts I could have had from a Dockin D Fine 2 as this gets pretty loud In fact I never felt the need to have this above 40 volume and this just sounds great It was annoying at first since it randomly increased the volume during audio playback when changing or restarting tracks but after unpairing from my devices and resetting the speaker it seems to have solved the issue I would have preferred physical buttons for previous and next track instead of the useless Bass up button since the feature can be enabled in the app You d need the app for firmware updates and sound customization and other settings like auto off when not in use which you can set to your preferred time The power button is a bit stiff and it s an arm workout to turn on this speaker It also just dies abruptly without any sound notification when using the aux cable not sure if its thw same with Bluetooth and takes over 4 hours to fully recharge You d want to enable Bass up or Custom but with a flat profile because it sounds exactly like Bass up Any other preset sounded terrible to my ears A disclaimer I use this speaker with Android and use only FLAC audio files which means I m taking full advantage of the AptX Bluetooth codec If your phone doesn t support AptX like an iPhone I wouldn t recommend the Motion Find something that supports AAC instead Ok so I ll be honest I don t care for this speaker for rock music That s my big criticism The rock I listen to is heavily layered and drenched in distortion and reverb Think wall of guitars style In other words the sound is huge and occupies the whole spectrum as a sort of singular mass of sound My Galaxy Buds handle this perfectly but The Motion seems to have a hard time and the sound is unbalanced like the speaker is trying to emphasize a certain frequency that doesn t make sense for this music Random frequencies of guitar distortion are elevated and it sounds really off even after playing with the EQ setting However for anything electronic I ve found this speaker sounds absolutely stunning and it seems to me that s what the Motion is geared for The clarity is unreal especially for a Bluetooth connection I listen to everything from heavy bass EDM to rich ethereal ambient music With the bass heavy EQ there is a massive bass presence but it remains a refined tight sound instead of a muddy boom like many other Bluetooth speakers The mids retain clarity and punch despite the bass and the treble is clear as glass All in all the sound is incredibly high quality and perfectly balanced but again just for electronic music in my experience This doesn t bother me too much because this is primarily what I listen to but many people aren t into electronic so I thought I d state this for fans of rock and metal Another thing to mention is the overall presence of the music I can flip this speaker around to face the wall and it still somehow fills the room with crystal clear sound The battery life is very long charging happens pretty quick and the aethetic of this speaker is just as appealing as everything else To recap If you re an Android user and you love electronic music just buy this thing You ll be blown away For everyone else though I d say there are much better options out there My old 12 watt Anker Soundcore was too quiet for some audio books I drive endless hours over the highways delivering your food to distribution centers Headsets are seen by the DOT at the pre clearance sites with those big cameras looking right inside the cab of the truck Also even the bone induction headsets cause an achy soreness after a few hours so a Bluetooth speaker is essential for listening when the truck radio s Bluetooth auxiliary is bad This new 30 watt Soundcore is plenty loud even when climbing up a 6 grade with 40 000 pounds cargo and the huge engine is screaming and the giant fan is blasting like a turboprop at takeoff I mistakenly bought an Oontz unit with 24 watts and it does not connect easily nor provide adequate clarity or volume the Anker Soundcore connects effortlessly Easy automatic reconnect even after my audio book is interrupted by a phone call I ve left the speaker on all night while I sleep and there s plenty of juice left for NPR news with coffee at 4 AM without plugging in the USB I really truly benefited from the table of products I found on Amazon for the Anker Soundcore speakers With that I found the perfect unit for my truck My old 12 watt unit lasted about 4 years blasting it s little heart out for me before it ruptured a diaphragm I was so sad it blew up so when I found the table of Anker Soundcore speakers I grabbed up my 30 watt unit because I trust the brand I couldn t be happier with it You might think that speech in an audio book would not need quality sound but the high res digital audio reproduces excellent clarity at any volume I need Quality sound is important for audio books so you catch every nuance and inflection of the voice actor I bought it specially for the truck and I just love it s audio quality substantial physical weight and higher volume capacity battery life is over the top and I know it will withstand the high vibration and moisture environment and keep blasting away because it s little brother did I will probably replace my big screen TV at home just so I can get a mega blaster that rattles the deck plates from Soundcore I own an original Bose Soundlink a Bose Soundlink Mini 2 Special Edition and the Soundcore Motion The Motion is far and away the best value of the three It s midrange beat the pants off both Bose speakers Without side by side comparison I think most people would be happy with a any of these speakers but when compared side to side my preference is definitely for the Motion It s the only one with a remote that has a graphic equalizer That s huge The ability to fine tune the sound to your individual hearing gives it a gigantic edge It sounds clean and full with decent bass not overly exaggerated and excellent midrange and highs It has good build quality and is also waterproof It can also be paired to a second Motion for a wider stereo soundstage The new Bose models also have this capability There is a microphone for using it as a Bluetooth speaker phone if that floats your boat It has a battery life rated at 12 hours though I haven t had it long enough to deplete the initial charge The Soundlink Mini 2 has a similar battery rating and I have to say is an engineering marvel Though not perfect the sounds that comes out of that tiny thing is nothing less than amazing I think the original Bose Soundlink has the best soundstage of the three followed by the Mini The soundstage on the Motion is decent but not quite as good as its competitors However I think the overall sound quality of the Motion across the frequency spectrum is definitely the best Highs electric guitar on the Mini can be somewhat strident and sounds much more smooth and natural on the Soundcore Motion The Soundcore just seems to have a much fuller sound with nothing or very little missing Keep in mind that these are all small portable Bluetooth speakers not high end studio monitors driven by great amplifiers so they all have limitations When switching to the Soundlink Mini 2 it sounds like something is missing Oh did I mention that the price of the Soundcore is only 100 bucks The Soundlink Mini 2 Special Edition is 150 at Costco That s 50 more and doesn t sound as good to me The original Soundlink sold for 300 if my memory serves me correctly If size is a driving factor then the Bose Mini 2 is worth exploring However if you can put up with a little larger but still relatively small speaker in my opinion you will not find a better sounding speaker than the Soundcore Motion in the 100 200 price range It s a solid buy Anker did a great job with this speaker I got this to make computer audio audible when playing videos outside with my small group For the price the sound is pretty impressive with decent bass and no obvious peaks I think the output is mono even though the speaker contains two drivers not a big deal on a small speaker meant to be listened to from a distance It feels very solid and heavy in the hand and the body has a soft touch coating on the plastic giving a nice feel Note though that I ve seen these coatings degrade into a gooey mess on other products though I haven t had any issues so far on the Motion My main gripe is with the way the speaker handles audio connectivity First when using it with a computer I generally want to use the wired connection for audio rather than Bluetooth However the Motion defaults to trying to connect via Bluetooth every time you start it up and sometimes it is difficult to figure out how to make it fall back to the wired connection There is something flakey about its detection that the audio cable is plugged in Second I don t know if this is a problem with the Motion or with Bluetooth in general but I ve seen some weird behavior when multiple devices have been configured to connect with the speaker Sometimes I d have it connected with a computer one foot away by Bluetooth when suddenly the audio would cut out and I d start hearing some other audio playing It turns out that the speaker was switching to playing from my mother in law s iPad that must have been 20 30 feet away at the time It is maddening to me that another device could just cut in on an existing Bluetooth connection like this It seems like a major security flaw Strangely I ve also seen my phone try to play audio to the speaker even when I am miles away at the time as if the phone can t tell that the speaker isn t present Due to these issues sometimes I have to just tell my devices to forget the speaker It s really frustrating Still I don t run into these issues often enough to make the speaker unusable and maybe I need to apply a firmware update or something I d still recommend the product for it s high quality audio for the price I expected this to sound pretty good based on reviews from various places certainly better than the less expensive bluetooth speakers I ve had I m a lifelong musician been around music of all types most of my life I am blown away by the fidelity of this speaker My musical tastes are all over the map Everything is game and this speaker handles it all impressively From Coltrane to the Stones and everything between Out of the box the frequency response is flat That is by design to give you a reference point for shaping the sound the way you want To appreciate the capabilities of this speaker you MUST download the Soundcore app where you can adjust the EQ to whatever suits you There are several presets in the app but the real difference maker is in the custom setting which gives you 9 bands of EQ to fiddle with If I had to describe this speaker s performance in one word that word would be balanced If you re into bass dominant listening rap hip hop you ll probably be better served by one of the boom box models This speaker offers rich full and natural sound across the frequency spectrum with plenty of volume as well Punches well above its weight class I ll grab another one when they re on sale again to have in other areas of the house Highly recommended I bought this speaker primarily to use outdoors on my deck and patio areas I researched reviews for bluetooth speakers under 100 from several reliable audio and tech websites then watched YouTube demos I narrowed my choices to Anker Tribit JBL and Oontz I chose the Anker Soundcore Motion for it s driver configuration full range drivers with separate tweeters passive radiator and bass port 30 watt power and size The ability to customize the sound with the Soundcore app was also a deciding factor When I received the speaker I was pleased with the build quality Initial set up was a snap took less than a minute I downloaded the Soundcore app and reviewed it s features and available options Now for the audition Let me preface by saying I am a guitar player I listen to real music played by real musicians playing real instruments I do NOT listen to computer generated sampled auto tuned disposable crap no offense to those that do everyone should listen to what they dig I began with Fleetwood Mac s self titled album from 1975 in ultra HD on Amazon music It s impeccably produced and has a great drum mix a true test for any speaker I scrolled through the pre sets on the Soundcore app for the first track and dialed in my custom EQ on the available equalizer I turned up the volume and stood back about 12 feet from the speaker My jaw dropped I could not believe the sound coming from this portable little speaker Great full range audio from lows to highs Mick s drum were punchy and deep Much better bass response than I anticipated though I did need to dial it in with the EQ Wonderful separation of instruments crystal clear vocals The soundstage was surprisingly wide with good depth for a single speaker configuration non stereo setup I was impressed and I am not easily I mainly listen to vinyl or CD on vintage audiophile quality equipment I also stream in ultra HD with a quality DAC The Soundcore Motion far exceeded my expectations Are there bluetooth speakers out there that are better or louder or have more bass Yes of course But not for 80 You will not be disappointed 08 10 2020 After several months of satisfactory performance I am raising my rating from 3 to 4 Original review In order to be fair I used the wired connection for this review The speakerphone feature works well which alone is making this a keeper for me The tiny drivers simply cannot produce anything close to a pair of 30 year old Sony amplified speakers with 3 drivers In fact the sound resembles the tiny USB speakers that came out 15 20 years ago possibly because that s where its sound comes from tiny speakers Of course for the price you do get some privileges namely bass reflex design and silk domes both of which far surpassing the potentials of cheap tiny computer speakers Some reviewers did note that using the app would give away your voice for free so that is obviously not an option for those who care for that sort of thing Without the utility that enables various equalizer settings out of which the basic setting should have been built in to begin with the device falls flat exhibiting all the shortcomings that its tiny drivers entail the uncompressed sound coming from an iPad 3 using music and movies from Amazon Prime Severely colored sound bad to the point that even mp3 sound just as good or shall I say bad as uncompressed sound Some people compared the sound to a DOSS Soundbox SL but the latter actually reflects the difference between mp3 and uncompressed sound to the point that mp3 comes through severely distorted because that s just the way mp3 sounds like Of course that makes this unit a winner for listening to mp3 For the Soundbox SL that s a punishment for producing untainted sound of course there are better speakers out there but they also cost more I got my SL for 56 at the manufacturer s site and got 30 off this one which I still find a bit much for the actual performance although I am sure that two of these would be much better than a single unit and these can be paired for stereo sound as opposed to the current Soundbox SL NOTICE that my DOS Soundbox stopped working properly after about 10 uses but is out of warranty and this one is working fine The bells and whistles silk domes for the treble and a passive membrane for the bass do contribute although only the treble is fairly improved because such tiny drivers simply cannot defeat physics Realistically speaking bass starts over 100Hz and any tweaking simply upsets the sound image and the sound balance The price is paid for1 Outstanding battery life2 Being somewhat waterproof I would not venture to experiment with that but splashproofness seems reasonably true 3 Sophisticated design with extra bass that is not really bass 4 Silk domes5 The option to pair two of these for stereo sound6 Excellent BT performance7 There is some stereo imaging if you are using this below a matchingly small screen However if you are looking for a steady sound image without loudness and detailed dynamic sound look elsewhere I wrote the following review and Soundcore s customer service was so amazing they offered to accept my return for a full refund Not everyone likes the same sound and this wasn t for me but I would not hesitate to buy from them again based on this experience Original review I was upgrading from a cheaper speaker and this one got good reviews However I don t think the sound is much better than my old one it doesn t feel very full it s kind of tinny I would have returned it but I messed up the box when I opened it and felt guilty about it I waited so long to purchase and researched so much I m very disappointed The operation is great good bluetooth connection and the app allows you to make changes to the sound profile if that s something you want to do I did but it didn t help me to like the speaker any better I originally purchased one red motion like 2 years ago The sound was really great with no real complaints except something was missing separate channel stereo sound So I recently decided to purchase a second motion but the 2 motion had different hardware and firmware so they weren t compatible I checked with Anker s excellent customer service and they confirmed that was the issue So I had to purchase a 2nd new one so they would pair together correctly The sound is truly incredible and its worth the extra money I had to pay to achieve it I can use the old motion in a different room as it s still going strong I updated my speaker to the latest firmware 45 something and it started having a delay on the audio starting when using the AUX port I use this speaker exclusively on my pc so it was really annoying To make it short I sent an email to Soundcore support explaining the situation and the speaker serial number they pushed an update to a previous version V37 38 This solved my issue If this was another manufacturer I probably would have been out of luck I m actually quite impressed Rewrite from an earlier review as Anker has reached out to me But they did NOT ask me to edit or change my review This is all my own doing just a heads up Initially I had purchased this product due to all the stellar reviews from various audio reviewers Item arrives and there is a terrible static almost like a grounding wire was knocked loose I m not sure Imagine turning on a CRT tv in the middle of the night at full volume with no signal I had used the motion in a different system different set up even had some friends of mine try a hand at it just to make sure it wasnt me But it happens there s bound to be a dud every so often I returned the unit for a replacement And that replacement same exact thing Same steps to troubleshoot but at that point I was done with the product I do have more anker products than I can count they make some great hardware but the motion in particular I figured I was done with Let other people enjoy it not worth the headache I left an earlier review expressing as much and sure enough a customer rep from Anker actually reached out to me I like most people have grown very cynical when it comes to dealing with companies standing by their products and actually honoring their warranties BUT the entire experience has more than made up for the earlier issues I m still waiting on the replacement to arrive but until then 5 5 at least for the customer service experience and that s saying a lot these days My use case Needed a better speaker for my desktop computer at work so I could listen to music and do conference calls as I upgraded from laptop to a beefy desktop for some heavier development work I was doing that required multiple virtual machines and all the memory I could afford For music I m not a trained ear but it packs a lot of bass for a small device even at lower volumes and sounds great for the kind of music I listen to while developing dubstep lofi electronic music classical jazz the rat pack michael buble r b rap Seems to do well enough across the gamut but I like it best for lower volume bass heavy instrumental music that I listen to while doing other tasks I ve tried to use other bluetooth speakers I have that have aux ports for my PC bose home speaker 300 in particular In comparison This sounds as good or better to me bose has a special warmth to it that this lacks but this seems more accurate and punches with just as much bass for a small speaker array This is portable has a battery that the bose doesn t The bose thinks I m talking to alexa all the time and does weird things that this doesn t The bose requires me to turn it back to Aux mode every time i sit down at my computer not sure why The bose doesn t have a mcirophone in it this does and seems to work wellMinor complaints for my use case Super short cords USB C and aux cords going to have to fix that The port cover on the side is a little annoying to have to leave open to get to the power aux ports It doesn t do bluetooth and aux sound at the same time while playing from your phone This is more minor annoyance because some apps play silent sound constantly when they are in the foreground which mutes computer sound even though nothing is playing More an issue with ios those apps but it s annoying when you get on a conference call and can t figure out why you can t hear people You can have a phone connected that s not playing any sound and play the computer audio without issue though This is workable I was deep in a slumber one frigid November night icy winds howling all around me the last embers fading in the fireplace when a vision came to me A figure with a powerful aura with kind eyes and surrounded by treasure whose beauty cannot be expressed with words I think it was maybe my friend David Anyway without opening his mouth he spoke deep into my soul A rumbling almost tectonic voice DO YOU FEEL COMPLETE I could not speak only a slight shake of my head once I understood that my answer was no DO YOU FEEL THE VOID THE MISSING PIECE OF THE PUZZLE I nodded more assertively this time without hesitation I CAN SHOW YOU THE WAY TO ENLIGHTENMENT IF YOU ARE READY This time I spoke A raw unfettered vocalisation from deep within me I could see my words taking the form of light twisting this way and that on their journey toward the dark figure Yes I feel ready Please make me whole I am ready I am ready A pause which felt like a lifetime ended as the figure still probably David began taking in a huge breath He took in more and more as if preparing for a war cry I could barely contain myself I shook in my place my gaze transfixed I had totally surrendered to whatever might happen now My soul was his As soon as he started to speak so began a sort of time lapse of my whole life up to that point like a flick book of all the important moments in my life It brought me to tears I wept joyous rapturous tears as his voice now even more seismic finally told me what I d been waiting so long to hear SOUNDCORE MOTION WITH USB C CHARGING 6 700mAh BATTERY 12 HOUR PLAYTIME 40kHz SILK DOME TWEETERS WITH ACTIVE CROSSOVER CUSTOMIZABLE EQ BLUETOOTH 5 0 AND IPX7 WATERPROOFING I woke with a jolt fresh tears in my eyes and adrenaline coursing through my body My hands were sweaty but even so I reached for my phone and immediately searched the words from the dark figure I ordered the speaker and yeah it s pretty good to be honest definitely bang for your buck As many other reviews have stated this is an almost perfect and to some perfect bluetooth speaker I waited a few weeks before leaving a review to be sure but I love it The sound quality is excellent as many others have stated this thing gets LOUD Use the custom EQ for the best sound I m a rap fan so as a bass heavy genre it handles it perfectly Noticed minor clipping on certain songs Top Back by T I for anyone who knows it as an example just go down one notch from max and it s good Definitely plan on buying a second to link together and my ONLY gripe is that it won t accept more lol It CAN play while charging if not charging from a fully dead battery it will cut off until it reaches a certain level Haven t played it constantly so I can t speak to the total battery life just yet however I ve used it intermittently for a couple hours for an entire week and it lasted with no problems so I imagine a full day at the beach would be fine The update solved the issues in the comments on the EQ saving and mine saved right out the box Outside of that it s done everything I needed and more can t wait until we can get back out and I can use it for it s intended purpose Stop reading reviews I read over 400 on various competing products and watched hours of YouTube videos so I got you on the research lol this is the one Update 12 21 21 I ve owned this speaker for about 2 years now so I have a full understanding of it s quirks and features and everything in between My original statement still stands BUY IT I have since bought another and saw someone else mention they are running more than 2 so please share how because I would have one in every room of the house if I could These have been everywhere Thrown in the back of the truck on beach day and plays LOUD the entire day When we hit the beach it s from 10 5 and they last the entire time I have received so many compliments from other people on the quality of sound from such a small speaker and the speakers themselves have been all in sand had water on them and continue running without a hiccup Someone mentioned it being invisible to bluetooth not sure what they were doing but I can hook these up to anything and have Phones my laptop my surface my TV everything I ve been checking for an updated version but honestly if it s not broke then don t fix it and these just work perfectly And for 100 you can t beat it Update Love the Soundcore Motion speaker so much I bought a second one They work great as a stereo pair I was looking for a bt speaker for under my monitor mainly to use with my computer but also something portable that I could carry around the house and to the pool for better sound than my phone speaker Sometimes I just don t want to have to wear earbuds The Soundcore Motion did not disappoint It s a solid performer has punchy bass and you can tune the EQ to your heart s content via the app The speaker has heft thanks to the 12 hour battery life It feels like a quality product It also has USB C charging which is a must in 2023 If I were to nit about anything if you hold the speaker up to your ear you can hear a distinct hiss when nothing s playing However practically speaking this doesn t bother me since at listening distance arm s length or longer you can t hear the hiss at all If they go on sale again I might buy another to pair it up I ve had a lot of Bluetooth speakers Sony JBL Creative Logitech UE Bose but I have to say I have become a true soundcore fan Besides this speaker I also have the Motion Boom and the Motion Boom Plus They all sound phenomenal In my opinion Soundcore gives you the most bang for your buck The Motion has become one of my favorite speakers so much so that I just ordered this one so I could hook them up in stereo Unfortunately when I got this speaker I couldn t get them to connect even though I followed the instructions I was informed by Soundcore that this was because my previous model had an older chip and firmware and they were not compatible I was prepared to send this one back but the Soundcore rep went above and beyond to help by letting me trade my older version for a new one WOW Great customer service I am certainly a Soundcore fan for life now I m a retired audiophile I ve had a lot of expensive stereo equipment in the past with outboard dacs and the whole nine yards You re not gonna get audiophile quality in a Bluetooth speaker especially one for a 100 or less However what you will get in this speaker is a lot of quality sound for the price It s definitely worthy of the near 5 star rating It s a very well rounded speaker with excellent highs good mids and more than adequate bass The app is user friendly and helpful in tailoring the sound to your liking You can add another for stereo and the customer service is what can I say excellent Overall it s a speaker well worth the money Quality Great Sound for the price point not as biG of a name as some others yet as good in sound Update Bluetooth on this speaker is the worst It takes precedence over a connection Also my husband keeps turning off the connection in the app and if he even touches his phone even having turned off the connection it automatically overrides my own Bluetooth connection while I m in the middle of playing a song He unpaired permanently and hopefully this will be fixed But there s the problem of my laptop I ll be sure to unpair that permanently too Never pair this thing with more than one device It blows because I need to use it with my laptop and my phone for original music projects I m working on The app doesn t do anything to help Bluetooth just needs to die However I ve not run into this with my little JBL speaker It will not allow anyone to connect to it when it s currently paired with something else Of course my stupid phone has no mini jack output so I can t give up on Bluetooth altogether Previous reviewI got this as a portable speaker to bring to music composition lessons I m composing music on the computer hobby only and it was hard to hear the lowest frequency instruments cello contrabass so far on my JBL clip speaker This isn t as good as studio monitor speakers but so much more portable And there s an equalizer in the app I work on music in a casual hobby band too and this will be much easier for me to hear the instruments particularly the bass in tracks they send me I usually use very large high quality speakers for music listening but don t consider myself an audiophile This is a Bluetooth speaker that s intended to be a portable convenience and has enough bass that you can hear the bass line loud and clear The sound overall is crisp and pleasing If I want the best I m not going to get that from a speaker I can put in a tote bag For about 100 this totable speaker is honestly amazing I bought one last year and have enjoyed using it Good value quality for under 100 However I recently bought the same model in order to create a stereo pair of speakers for a projector setup When I received the new speaker I tried pairing the speakers together and couldn t get it for the life of me I contacted Soundcore customer support and they informed me that even though they have the same model name and number that I bought a newer version that CANNOT pair with the old version and that the old version could not be upgraded to pair with the new version I think it is absolutely ridiculous that two speakers that are the same model cannot pair together even though that is an advertised feature That is something that should be clearly stated as I now have to go through the hassle of returning it and wasted an hour of my life trying to get the speakers to pair Majorly disappointed UPDATE Worked with Anker customer support and they were able to send me a new one that works Great customer support experience The sound quality is amazing it gets more than loud enough and it connects to my phone instantly as soon as I turn it on It is about double the size I expected it to be but it still fits in the location I had planned for it It is about the size of my forearm so be warned if you want a super mobile and light speaker this one will take up a significant amount of room in a backpack suitcase or purse and has some heft to it Amazing overall though Highly recommend as a medium size Bluetooth speaker I have an older Altec Lansing BT speaker It s small I ve had it for a few years it works pretty well for what it is I probably paid 60 for it when I got it I wanted something better with more bass better sounds I don t need multiple speaker set up or anything like that I m a musician well keyboard player and my standard of reference is a pair of KRK Rokit RP 5s They are very nice low end monitoring speakers and I drive them from a high end D A converter The sound for me at 64 years of age is all that I need The Soundcore Motion blew me away with it s sound I would say that it rivals the RP 5s in clarity and sound discrimination I did a lot of research on new BT speaker meaning I watches some YouTube videos and the Soundcore Motion always seemed to come out near the top of the pack I can see why If you want clear crisp highs a wonderful midrange and bass that is clear and accurate I m not talking window rattling bass but bass that sounds like acoustic bass should then this really is the speaker for you The free downloadable app for your phone gives you custom EQ capabilities plus there s an aux in for laptops and such that may not use BT I am truly impressed by this I m also further impressed that by an additional 10 shipping cost I ordered at 11 a m and had the unit here at 6 p m The only thing that would have made it any better was if it had gotten here 30 minutes sooner since I was going out to a party and it would have worked wonders there So if you re on the fence about this speaker spend the 105 for it I haven t listened to the Bose or the Sony or the JBL speakers all of which are probably good speakers but in the 100 range I don t think you re going to do too much better than this speaker Buy it Tell em I sent ya Read the reviews so I took the plunge I wanted to like it a lot but the sound quality left too much to be desire for my taste Even with the app which allows you to make various adjustments I could never really fine tune to my liking We sent it back and purchased our second Beats Pill To each his own UPDATE BELOW First The Good Anker Soundcore Motion Bluetooth Speaker delivers excellent sound for the money on a variety of music genres But I will say that in my specific case I did need to use the EQ available as an app download to get my sound to a level that would make this beautiful looking speaker shine Now about that app Once the Anker Soundcore Motion Bluetooth Speaker is charged you will want to set up the previously mentioned custom EQ To do that you ll have to download the app To use the Ankers Soundcore App it does seem to want a lot of feedback which I m sure is for future product enhancements The decision is yours to use it or not I had no problem The longer we have used the speaker the more we enjoy the fun that comes with it From its portable design sturdy and solid craftsmanship it s built to last One thing I enjoy is the power button glows white while powered and changes to a blinking red when the battery is low In this mode it automatically plays at a reduced volume until plugged in Once plugged into a charger via the USB C port Anker Soundcore Motion Bluetooth Speaker increases in volume and continues to play while charging Nice touch I was able to get all of my eclectic music to sound very fine tuned I especially loved how I could Bluetooth to my TV and have my own personal speaker as to not disturb the neighbors on those late nights My one issue is that at higher volumes it did tend to distort and I could not find a fix but with many EQ settings at my disposal we were able to come to a happy experience and satisfied with the sound This is a solid speaker with the potential to sit alongside the BEATS PILL which I own UE BOOMBOX which I own and in my opinion is much better than the Bose SoundLink Mini II Bluetooth Speaker which I own Lastly the speaker gets 4 stars for quality and price but because Anker is invested in providing outstanding products and customer service then my all around score is a solid 5 Great Fathers Day gift people I d love another for Fathers Day Replaced a JBL speaker that had blown with this Very happy I did Cost almost half as much and sounds just as good There s no earth shaking bass but the sound remains clear at louder volumes I will be purchasing another to use in stereo for my patio I ve had this over 2 years now and have used it every single day I have worn the battery down to the point this speaker is about to give up the ghost it will NOT work even plugged in once the battery is dead My ONLY gripe with this is I can t just simply replace the batteries now I have to spend another 100 TERRIBLE for the environment All that said the sound quality of this speaker is incredible especially on the bass side All the good stuff everyone says is true sometimes when it sounds too good to be true it is actually true I bought 4 Motion speakers to configure in 2 stereo pairs for my office and living room to replace my Sonos Play1 and Play3 speakers after Sonos once again screwed over its users with personal music libraries The sound quality and dynamic range of the speakers is excellent While not quite as good as the Sonos speakers for the these speakers nail the sound Pairing 2 speakers in a stereo pair is very easy The speakers have multiple sound presets and a 9 band EQ configurable via the mobile app NOTE I also bought the Space Q45 NC headphones and used the HearID recommended 8 band EQ settings for configuring the Motion EQ I absolutely love the sound from the speakers with my custom EQ settings for Rock Blues and Metal I can t speak to the battery life because I bought Anker USB power adapters and all 4 speakers are connected to power 100 of the time The mobile app is serviceable but short on extra features For instance the app only tracks one pair of the Motion speaker pairs at a time The app has to disconnect from one set to connect to another Also there is no L R fader function in the app to adjust the balance between the paired speakers I have submitted requests to Anker Soundcore support to add features to remember devices and customize the names and to add the fader feature Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase of the Motion speakers I got this for basically two reasons to watch YouTube Hulu Netflix on my 2021 iPad and to have a decent speaker to quickly set up in a garage for when I have people over to listen to music I am extremely happy with the streaming video synchronization While watching almost anything I cannot pick up any delay in the sound vs peoples lips on screen a constant problem I ve had with earlier Bluetooth devices I ve had identical experiences with my Android phone as well However my devices are fairly up to date on the Bluetooth standards and that is likely why they work so well Experiences will vary if you have a device with older bluetooth equipment in them I have had no problems with the app and dialing in the sound for my music The presets are ok but really only ok But after some minor tweaking it really is as good as advertised And it can get loud enough for me When I crank it all the way up I have to really try to be heard over it so if you need it loud I think this does a very serviceable job I haven t run it down to empty yet but I ve used it for numerous hours in a row without issue Also it charges quickly and works fine to run while being charged if being used at home like mine is I bought to use a bluetooth bedroom speaker It suits that bill well Sound is good but not perfect Short power supply cord it is designed more for battery charging and travel I found a longer USB C cord of my own to allow proper room placement and connection to power Also a small rubber door covers the plug into the speaker and looks a bit untidy for permanent set up like mine So overall the value proposition is fine I could get a better speaker for twice the money And it would look slightly better in my set up but not worth the spend for my needs Bought for my shop and it checks all boxes I was looking for Bought an Oontz Angle 3 first and found it to be junk Returned and tried the Soundcore for more money and it did the trick Great battery life and can turn up the volume with little distortion This is probably your best option at this price point in the large but still somewhat packable speaker market The speaker is slightly larger than a 20 oz soda bottle laid flat but much heavier you could pack this in a suitcase but it s probably going to take up too much room in a carry on or backpack unless you aren t bringing much else It ll probably do fine in a bag to take to the beach or a cookout It produces enough clear sound to fill large rooms easily and sounds good with the bass boost activated and not great without it I m docking one star because in an effort to be sleek and waterproof Anker sacrificed some ease of use with the button layout As you can see in the picture above there are five buttons on the top of the speaker In short the buttons are confusing mushy and easily show wear Two of the buttons you are likely using most often the volume buttons are the 2nd and 5th buttons in the layout If you aren t looking directly at the speaker it s very easy to accidentally hit the Bluetooth pairing button when attempting to turn the volume up or to hit the center button when trying to turn the volume down The center button is just the logo which gives no indication to what it actually does multifunction play pause skip which is fine if you own the speaker but not great if you ask someone else to change songs Finally the buttons have that mushy silicone feel that makes you wonder if you actually activated it and despite attempting to clean them they look very worn after only a few presses I know that some of this was probably done to improve the waterproofing of the speaker I have to wonder who the audience is supposed to be then Are people taking these into the ocean Or into their swimming pools at home Or dancing in the rain It just doesn t feel like a common enough use case to warrant the trade off These small ish quibbles aside I ve enjoyed the speaker and I think it s still the best option at this price point I just think if could be even better i was looking for a portable speaker that could be used outdoor for sports or social gatherings but also had enough sound quality for indoor listening the speakers had a neutral sound signature very similar to sennheiser u can hear layers of the instrumentals and vocals highs came out clear without distortion even at high volume bass didn t sound synthetic but i would say is kind of missing particularly lows and u don t feel any punch from the bass although highs come out clear it leaves u wanting more as u max out the volume to really fill the space and to jam out overall a great quality sounding speaker it just wasn t the sound i was looking for Bought this as an external laptop speaker for when I m away from home Tried a couple of tunes right away Don t Panic by Coldplay sounded great Some punk songs from NOFX sounded quite muddy Like I think any average person without a particularly good ear for sound would notice the quality issue But in reality I ll mostly use this for stuff like listening to some podcasts or gaming at night before I pass out Vocals in my fave YouTuber channels sound excellent arguably even better than my desktop speakers in some ways Gaming is somewhere between my laptop and desktop speakers but certainly better than the latter so they serve their purpose as I m not going to lug around my desktop speakers For the price should have come with a case and also a wall charger and USB cord Comes with none of these Also a bit of a fingerprint magnet though generally looks and feels sleek Deducted a star for hit or miss sound quality and another star for missing features for the price point EDIT Apparently supposed to come with a charging cord The company did contact me separately and send one with an apology credit Updating to 4 stars Still think a case should be included for the price being mindful of the sound quality I liked the sound of this speaker and the accompanying app I bought one last July and have enjoyed it To my ears it sounds better even using the supported compressed AAC Bluetooth and SBC codecs with my iOS iPhone and IPad and Amazon Fire tablet 10 devices than my Sonos Roam speaker sounds via lossless eg with Amazon HD Music using Sonos Wi Fi app or airplay2 I just bought another one yesterday solely to add stereo pairing and it was on sale However I couldn t get this feature to work After trying all the trouble shooting steps on their website I called Soundcore They said that their engineers changed the Bluetooth chip on the newer speaker version and that s why my 2 speakers wouldn t pair Fortunately I was just a few days within my warranty and they told me to send the older one back and that they would ship out a replacement with the new chipset Hopefully the stereo pairing will work once I receive it I knocked off one star for this issue For the price I don t think you can find a clearer fuller range complete sound as these speakers produce Absolutely Fabulous Better then my Bose small speakers at 1 3rd the price Sounds great Good bass response and clear mids and highs This speaker really comes to life when you have two and link then together for true wireless stereo It has good power so it gets pretty loud however if you are looking for a speaker that will make your ears bleed this is not for you For nearly three years my speaker has been an absolute gem in my life I can t help but rave about its remarkable features and consistent performance From its waterproof design to its booming sound this speaker ticks all the right boxes for me The waterproof feature has been a game changer It s accompanied me to poolside gatherings and beach trips without any worries And speaking of sound the volume and audio quality continue to impress It s loud enough to set the mood for any occasion and the clarity of the audio never fails to amaze me What s more the durability of this speaker has stood the test of time It s endured countless adventures and still performs like new The ease of connecting via Bluetooth makes playing music a breeze and the battery life has consistently kept up with my longest playlists Overall my love for this speaker has only grown over the years It s become an integral part of my daily life enhancing every moment with its stellar sound and rugged design If you re in the market for a Bluetooth speaker under 100 bucks that truly delivers on its promises look no further I give it a resounding 5 out of 5 stars without hesitation Update 7 15 2021 Perhaps there was a break in period on this unit because the longer I ve had it the better it sounds even at higher volumes Since everyone s hearing is different I really recommend using the Soundcore app on your phone and do Custom EQ settings that sound right to you I didn t like any of the EQ Presets So I have officially changed my mind and increased my rating from 3 to 4 Stars I think this was worth the price and would definitely recommend this BT Speaker Original From Feb 2021 I m a bit disappointed for the price considering it supposed to be 30W of power Thought I would take the chance since it has separate left and right mid range and tweeter drivers There are so many positive reviews and youtube videos comparing this to the larger JBL Charge 4 and others In my opinion this doesn t sound as good or pack the punch of the smaller JBL Flip 4 or 5 I put the Soundcore app on my phone tried the BassUp and all EQ Presets It sounded better with my own Custom EQ settings It sounds pretty good up to half volume Going above that and there is distortion in the mid range and treble and gets worse the higher it goes The max volume is tied to my Bluetooth device and once the max is reached on the device then pressing the volume up on the speaker has no effect On other BT speakers like JBL Sony I can increase the volume more on the speakers after the BT sources is at max volume Listening to quality music is very important to me and 98 of my music library is full CD quality FLAC files Either I got a defective unit or Anker is putting out a lot of dishonest review and videos I m thinking about returning this and going with the JBL Flip 5 even though it has only 1 active Transducer driver Anker had a good idea here for a compact BT speaker but it doesn t live up to all the hype I love this thing First off I think it looks good I like that one can see the speakers through the grill while feeling confident that said speakers are well protected since themesh is metal not fabric This will make wiping it down easier too I hate fabric speaker covers they re dust magnets and a pain to clean The sound Remarkable Especially for such a small sized unit Honestly it looks bigger in the photos and it s the perfect size for any shelf or table The sound is so crisp and clear yet you can honestly feel the bass and that s not even with the Bass boost enabled The Soundcore app is easy to use and gives you access to an EQ mixer as well as a range of presets I use the EQ mixer and you can clearly hear the difference as you adjust It s also clearly well made The unit feels hella solid and it s surprisingly heavy which is a good thing You re not likely to find great quality sound and quality construction in a plastic lightweight speaker This bad boy has a metal body and feels solid AF My only knock would be that the control buttons on top of the unit are unlit and the same color black as the rest of the unit making it difficult to see which button is which But this is really pretty minor given that most of us will use the soundcore app or our music app to adjust the controls instead of manually with the hard to read buttons Also once you learn which does what it s a non issue I highly recommend this speaker for anyone who wants a high quality portable speaker with excellent sound for size price You cannot go wrong and Anker is a quality company with excellent customer service so you can buy with confidence I ordered this Bluetooth speaker to replace my Anker Soundcore Boost that served me well for 3 years as a speaker for my PC As a higher priced device I was hoping that it would be an improvement in sound quality over my former speaker But it s about the same maybe even a little worse The speaker sounds pretty flat out of the box and you need to use the Soundcore app on your phone to EQ it for a richer wider sound This EQ doesn t stay when you disconnect from your phone and use a computer there s no soundcore app for windows overall the default sound is acceptable but I m sure there s speakers out there that sound better for 100 I got the speaker for about 80 with a sale The speaker is also way bigger and heavier than the Boost The boost is pretty easy to pack in a camping bag or backpack but the Motion is a bit unwieldy and awkward The upside for this is that the battery should be much better and it is notably louder but those two perks are irrelevant for my use case and the Boost was loud enough with a good enough battery If you re considering this speaker I d go for the Soundcore Boost instead I was looking for a small speaker that has good quality sound This has been perfect It has good clear sound and is easy to use Whether I ve paired it to listen to music watch a movie or audiobooks this has been a great option Highly recommend I purchased this speaker based on all of the hype from Youtube reviewers and other written roundups I ve read online I already have a couple of Bluetooth speakers but needed something louder to use in a classic car that has a dead stereo system I also have a Soundcore Wakey alarm clock and was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and volume from that speaker so I figured this would be similar Indeed the Motion is a very nice speaker The ability to adjust the EQ and dial it in is a killer feature that makes this brand and speaker stand out from the pack Volume is also pretty good It won t make your ears bleed but it ll fill a living room Overall it s definitely a nice speaker It feels sturdy and is easy to use If you re looking for a pounding bass this isn t the speaker for you It you re even looking for a deeper thicker bass this won t cut it However my phone allows me to play music from two Bluetooth speakers at once so I ve paired this with a W King X10 When I have the EQ on this one with boosted mids and treble the combo with both speakers playing at once sounds incredible and is almost gets to the point of being too loud for my ears I have had a lot of issues with pairing this speaker though which seems to be the biggest downfall I was able to get it to pair with my phone but when I try to pair with my computers I ve tried two other ones it doesn t seem to appear in the available Bluetooth devices It s very odd and I looked up this issue and it seems to be a recurring issue with this speaker Fortunately I requested a replacement from Amazon so it s on the way thank you for doing that btw Amazon Hopefully the next one doesn t have the same pairing issues This device achieves a sweet spot of top quality sound and portability I have an early model beats pill which is excellent high range sound but deficient base I recently bought a Bose mini which is light weight but poor sound quality which really overemphasizes base to the point of distortion Let s face it laptop speakers suck So when I had to go laptop only for a few months I decided to try a Bluetooth speaker to make music and movies a little more tolerable While an Anker user I have their chargers and power packs and didn t even realize they offered speakers When I saw several positive reviews of the Soundcore Motion Plus I figured I would give it a try I have NOT been disappointed it is an excellent speaker for what it does Of course I didn t expect an audiophile level speaker but it is surprisingly musical and pleasant to listen to It can provide some bass boost to fill out the sound at lower listening volumes which worked well for my situation I can t speak to the water resistance rating or the 3 5mm aux input but with Bluetooth I get at least 12 hours of play time before needing to hook it to a charger For my use case it is an excellent speaker The app Not so much I find it tries too hard to belong to the Fruity Device User Culture which hides the real functionality of behind layers and slide menus It does let you check and update the firmware if you can find the device settings menu It does give you some control over the sound signature and even a custom EQ option but I find it a pain to mess with these settings I leave it on Bass Heavy and it sounds fine to me I just turn Bass Boost on and off when I need it The tiny battery charge level indicator really needs a percentage display next to it Finally there seems to be some interference with speaker operation even when the app is closed and Bluetooth still on The app has the potential to be useful with the speaker if Anker Soundcore would put a little effort in refining the app So why five stars I didn t really need the app to use the speaker and the speaker is excellent The bass is amazing for it s size battery lasts a long time worth the money It was on sale for 69 at Amazon so I decided to buy it That s a very good price but I played it side to side with my Denon Envaya 250BT hoping that I would get a better sound overall according to some reviews and the specs The Anker does sound good with the EQ adjusted however the interesting results started to show when comparing at higher volumes beyond 50 volume I noticed I was getting some sort of distorsion from the Anker so I ran the frequency generator to check the bass extension and then I found the distorsion was caused from the rear radiator since it has some sort of port that causes the air to overflow and hence produce noise when played at higher levels On the other hand Denon bass was nice and clean around the 50 60hz That easily concluded for me that I was getting a cleaner higher end sound from the Envaya than from the Anker Don t get me wrong the speaker is really well built and I do like the features it has but does not match the sound you can get from Denon which is reflected in the price specially with its tridimensional effect it produces and without having to adjust EQ to have it sound good I will return the Anker EDIT on 1 29 20 I was contacted by Anker directly to my email and they offered me a free replacement for my speaker in order to make sure I was happy about my purchase and my speaker I think this is a awesome customer support Kudos for that After a more extended listening and having it as my main portable speaker for some time I can assure this speaker sounds great for the money The highs mids and lows are impressive for its size and I think it s because the neodynium magnets it has punching beyond its size I specifically was happier with the mid frequencies on the Anker than the Denon and also the bass was more noticeable in the lower frequencies I do think EQing correctly really helps on not pushing this speaker beyond its limits Based on this I raised to 4 stars but also I KEPT the Anker which will become my daily speaker for casual listening I m glad Anker contacted me since that made sure I was treated seriusoly by a company that do cares about their customers which I think is great Thanks guys Really good Bluetooth speaker at this price I m always happy with Soundcore products This isn t a knock against Soundcore at all but all most of these style of speakers are just missing that last 10 sound quality to make them sound like a good pair of old school speakers Either way I d still buy these again I love the size the app to adjust the equalizer etc Would recommend to a friend The JBL Charge 5 is the BEST speaker I have ever owned I have had the average run of the mill bluetooth speaker that has around a 20 value for over a year and I thought it was good sound quality and I never thought I needed something fancy Well that speaker started having problems and I was carefully searching for another speaker I found this speaker and I thought I would try something new I only had one thought as I played music out of it for the first time WOW The JBL Charge 5 has the best sound quality I had ever heard from a bluetooth speaker I don t ever plan on getting another speaker that is a speaker that isn t JBL or an upgraded version of the Charge 5 The clarity is absolutely stunning The bass is DEEP I can feel the bass through my whole room The volume is insane I rarely have it over 50 but in the event where I need it louder I turn it up I once had music filling a whole event center that was quite a reasonable size If I could choose one word to describe this speaker it would be Stunning Powerful or Supercharged Pun intended On that note the battery life on this thing is long I once had the speaker provide some background noise for about two days and the battery life was barely lower than 70 I think it s hard to tell exactly with the battery indicator definitely above 60 Of course the battery drains quicker when you have the speaker playing at high volumes Also it can take some water Some being a little I prefer not to put it to the test Here is my takeaway DESIGN 9 10 Great I love the fabric covering The JBL logo is made of metal which makes it look very nice and official The buttons are easy to distinguish and the light is on the power bluetooth and there is a ring of light around those two buttons when PartyBoost is in effect There is a battery bar right below the JBL Logo and it serves as a general battery indicator You can get the 100 75 50 and 25 You can get more info on the battery via the app The weight is surprisingly light considering the volume this speaker is capable of Although it isn t the most portable of portable speakers as it is a little big and has a football shape You can get a case for it that has a strap though For the skip feature you have to press the play pause button twice Make sure that when you do this you maintain a consistent interval of time between the two presses If you do it too fast it will just pause If you do it too slow it will just pause then play again BATTERY 10 10 Perfect I absolutely love the battery I m the kind of person that prefers the longest possible battery and doing whatever it takes to preserve it I don t have to worry much about this battery Like I said it has provided some low music for almost 2 days and the battery wasn t that affected However the battery life will drain much more rapidly when using the speaker at high volumes I currently use this speaker with a projector to watch TV I have watched lots of movies and TV shows and I don t have to pay much attention to the battery I just plug it in every other night and it does great And having a battery bank is the cherry on top I haven t used it much as I keep most of my devices fully charged but I think it is awesome that it has a battery bank if I need it SOUND QUALITY 10 10 10 5 10 Stunning I didn t expect that sound quality could get this good for a bluetooth speaker JBL means business When I turn it to high volumes I can actually feel air blowing from it On that note it can go REALLY high in volume I did not expect that at all Insane volume As stated earlier I use this with a projector and for all my TV Watching movies with this speaker makes the entire experience cinematic A much bigger upgrade compared to the sound TV s come with I would even say that it can contend with some soundbars out there not the JBL Surround Sound System though that one seems like the top tier of JBL This speaker was my first experience with JBL speakers other than the car speakers and I was very impressed It has been the best sound experience I have ever had Really clear and crisp audio and when I say really I mean truly When playing music I can hear every instrument every breath and incredible bass The bass is a superstar in and of itself Like I said the bass shakes my whole room when playing music and when watching movies The side radiators really really pack a punch There is even an adjustable EQ on the app Though I prefer what the speaker came with It is a little pricey just a little but know that you get what you pay for I don t think that I can ever go back to what I had PARTYBOOST 9 10 Great I had one so I bought two more so I could create a surround sound with my TV It kinda worked I think I had some sort of connectivity issue so all I ll say is that the range might not be that great so make sure you keep them somewhat close If you have a projector that has bluetooth and you want to use PartyBoost I would consider researching what you can do with the Bluetooth latency As stated earlier I watch TV with this and please note there IS some lag between sound and video as bluetooth will do However that is just bluetooth technology not JBL Over time my ears and eyes have adjusted and now it is not that big a deal In addition to standard bluetooth latency PartyBoost will make this delay greater I ended up returning the other two because of this issue For music this is not a problem because it is just sound and no video With music PartyBoost is pretty cool It really creates a much louder and much cooler sound experience You can even use just two for a stereo effect and it works great Overall this has been the BEST bluetooth speaker experience I have ever had You better believe I ll be there for the Charge 6 or 7 or wherever they decide to take this They really have something good going here I would 110 recommend this If you are reading this review and you would like an upgrade to your typical listening experience know that this is one of the best out there And if you catch this at a discounted price you ll know you are getting a great deal JBL has been the best listening experience for me I will continue buying their products if they keep supplying a high quality experience I mean let the 27 000 ratings with a 4 8 overall rating speak for itself Here is a simplified pro con list PROS Excellent audio clarity Excellent bass Excellent overall sound Exceptional volume Long battery life Battery bank feature Waterproof feature Adjustable EQ Stereo Effect PartyBoost for multiple speakersCONS Button timing for the skip track Could be slightly more portable We do have the Flip speakers for that though The media could not be loaded I recently got my hands on the JBL CHARGE 5 Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker and I have to say it s been an awesome addition to my music setup Whether I m chilling at home heading to the beach or just hanging out in the backyard this speaker has been delivering on all fronts First off let s talk about the sound quality It s impressive The audio is clear and crisp making everything from podcasts to my favorite tracks sound fantastic The bass is particularly noteworthy it s deep and punchy without being overwhelming I ve had other portable speakers before but this one definitely stands out in terms of delivering that full rich sound we all crave The build quality of the JBL CHARGE 5 is also top notch It feels solid and durable which is exactly what you need in a portable speaker I m not the gentlest person with my gadgets so knowing this speaker can withstand a bit of rough handling is a huge plus The waterproof feature is a game changer too I ve taken it to the pool and the beach and it s held up perfectly fine even after getting splashed No worries about a bit of water ruining the fun Another awesome feature is the battery life With up to 20 hours of playtime this speaker keeps the party going all day and night And the powerbank USB charge out is a lifesaver I can charge my phone on the go which is super handy during long outings or when I forget to charge my phone beforehand JBL PartyBoost is another cool feature that lets you pair multiple JBL speakers for an even bigger sound I haven t tried it yet but it sounds like a blast for larger gatherings Honestly I ve struggled to find any real cons with this speaker It s a bit on the heavier side but considering the sound quality and battery life it s a trade off I m happy to make The price is a bit higher compared to some other portable speakers but you re definitely getting what you pay for in terms of quality and performance In conclusion the JBL CHARGE 5 is a fantastic portable speaker that s worth every penny With clear clean sound excellent bass and high quality materials it s perfect for anyone looking to amp up their music experience Whether you re an audiophile or just someone who loves good tunes on the go this speaker won t disappoint Highly recommended This is the perfect little system to enjoy music out on my patio while I m gardening or in my wood shop It s a great size and the sound quality is fantastic I love that I don t have to worry if it gets wet or dusty Just like everything JBL makes this little unit is durable and clearly built to last I had it up and running in minutes and the music is clear My audio books sound amazing on it too I haven t blasted it too you d because I m old and don t like loud music so I can t say anything about range but it is clear attractive a great size the battery lasts a long time and very easy to use This speaker is amazing Bluetooth connectivity is great It s extremely durable and lightweight It s a tad big but doesn t take up to much space The sound quality and battery life is fantastic Last up to 5 6 hours I highly recommend I didn t think I would get this much sound out of small speaker It s got great range for bluetooth connectivity although most of the time my phone is quite close It picks up the signal easily and begins playing music immediately I love the fact that I can plug in my phone to charge it and not worry about it draining while I listen to music The price is reasonable for a quality brand that puts out substantial sound BIG sound Easy to pair Decent range Pleasant quality Good deal I ve only owned my JBL Charge 5 for a few days but it already started making random crackling sounds I got the impression that the Bluetooth is having trouble even though my phone is only 3 feet away I also own a Flip 4 and it never had an issue Other than that the sound is good while it s working Unfortunately I feel like I should return this or exchange for another unit Update Installed the latest firmware 0 8 8 6 via the JBL Portable app and have not heard any crackling sounds from the speaker lately Increased my rating from 3 to 4 I m coming from owning a Bose Soundlink Revolve for the last 2 years I use at home but wanted something for the office I got this JBL to play background music in my office BUT tried it at home cranked up WOW I honestly think the JBL has better sound at higher volume than the Bose Revolve Both doo fine for background music at work but I find myself dragging this JBL with me to friends houses to the pool out on the patio Bluetooth to my phone pick a Spotify playlist and I m see for the day This has an extra charging port on the back to keep my phone running while playing at the pool all afternoon A nice feature not tried it yet but the speaker itself runs all day and never run out of juice It s lightweight easy to carry along The two sides have a passive radiator that enhances the low bass I know the Bose has good low bass too This speaker is my 3rd JBL I first bought the JBL Pulse 5 speaker awhile back and I really love that one especially for the light show it can do but it s a little large to pack up and haul Then I bought the JBL Flip 6 which is smaller but still can pack a nice punch but only if you turn it up really loud I really love the JBL Flip 6 because it is extremely portable but I decided that I wanted to try this JBL Charge 5 because I love the camouflage pattern on it and it seemed like a good in between speaker from the other two speakers I m comparing here As it turns out the JBL Charge 5 is the best choice for me in terms of portability and sound It s got a really nice full sound and I don t have to turn it up quite as loud as the JBL Flip 6 to achieve the full sound I like That means to me that I have more volume to play with if I really jam out to some good music In the future I would like to try the JBL Extreme even though I know it s not as portable as these other speakers I have Anyway I really love this JBL Charge 5 and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a bluetooth speaker that can get loud but offers easy portability Love it this speaker has a great sound compared to others in the market I love that you can carry it whatever place I want The only issue is maybe the bass is not as loud as other speakers but that is fine for me dont get me wrong im not a huge sound person i like things that sound nice but am not one of those people that pick things apart when it comes to sound this little speaker is super nice i link my phone to the thing and just go and the sound is loud enough to hear over my motorcycle would recommend to friends price is a bit high but seems worth it the device seems like it will last So I was looking for a speaker that was loud enough to be heard throughout the gym while playing but still small enough to fit comfortably in my gym bag While this is a bit bigger than my last portable speaker the sound is SO much better and louder and the sound quality is still really good at louder volumes Highly recommend The only thing I would love to see is a little bag that would protect the speaker and keep the cords together I own 3 now Bought 3 for gifts Best out there And they all link together for whole house music They are next level above my old Flip 5 s that I used to buy Out of the box you could tell it was very well designed and built I literally turned it on saw it appear on my BlueTooth connected and started playing music in 10 sec We take it everywhere and it has great sound for its size e g at the beach out on the deck or even in the house Extremely solid easy to use and with great sound Can t really go wrong here I was looking for a speaker That had a stereo sound I thought I was going to have to pay a lot more to get what I wanted but this was everything I was looking for We have only turned it up to number four on the volume It sounds amazing Had heard JBL was good and I liked that it was water resistant This little thing blast tunes clearly 100 feet away Connects to a phone immediately when you turn it on Oh does your phone need a quick charge The speaker has you covered Throw it in a beach bag or backpack It s half the size of my last Bose speaker and louder crisper It s not inexpensive but it s more bang or bass for the buck than I expected My niece is an exercise instructor that has an outside fitness class You can hear the music in spite of all the outside noises of city life She loves it First time buying a used item came in original box looks looks and performs like brand New quality of the sound is as described Kept a charge all day still don t have to recharge after eight hours This is my second JBL speaker love them I love this speaker for the ability to bring it wherever I want to and I love the quality of sound it has Easy bluetooth connectivity incredible sound so happy I made this purchase I bought my son the flip He loves his as well I have used a Bose speaker for quite some time On a trip to Mexico a friend s JVC Charge 3 blew my Bose speaker away Then I was on Turks and I knocked my buddy s Charge 4 into the pool The music never stopped and I was sold I ordered my Charge 5 as soon as I got back and had it 24 hours later It s the best portable Bluetooth speaker in the market I did a dry run on the sound for Bluetooth speakers at a local Target store Out of all of them Bose Marshall Altec and JBL JBL was by far the clearest and the best The bass was smooth and the treble did not distort When I received this one it was by far the easiest Bluetooth I have ever had to connect to my phone I would recommend this one over Bose any time Bought this for a family trip last year and haven t stopped using it since Also syncs up with other JBL speakers so we can daisy chain them and have surround sound Great bass frequency and loudness I ve used this alot and highly recommend it Very portable and produces good volume and quality sound This is the best speaker that I have ever purchased The sound quality is amazing good quality and easy to travel with Had the previous version for about 6 years Loved it Unfortunately someone loved it more than I did and helped themselves to it Bought this one Great sound quick connectivity Item as described I was in a hurry to order this item and did not have time to drive to bestbuy i was sceptical to order from amazon but it is great and original new the sound is great much better than flip and bose for a little more price This item was eligible for setting up a password to receive from amazon driver I suggest it if you are in an area that are not so safe The camo color looks good matches my hunting cabin Charges quick easy to use and connect I m no audiophile but this is a great speaker I ve had a Logitech speaker for several years and have loved it It was between a Bose speaker and this over the Bose mainly due to the price I can t imagine the Bose being almost 100 better then this especially for basic home use This fills a room and has decent bass for the size and cost Battery life will never be as good as we d like but it is good This little speaker has a lot of base We love it and I m sure it s going to get a ton of use Would recommend Wanted to keep it as it s a great sounding speaker but friend had a Charge 4 and I wanted to be able to pair with his for stereo Unfortunately the Charge 5 uses a different party mode and could not connect Will have to decide if get an older Charge 4 or if friend can justify getting a Charge 5 Would give it 5 stars if it was compatible with all other JBL speakers I purchased two of these to work as a stereo pair in my apartment to obtain a nice full sound without having to really crank the volume to have an enjoyable experience and bother the neighbors Well it all started out great the white look clean and are small enough to not take up too much visual space They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed They are setup roughly 15 feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers Now for THE PROBLEMS I synced the speakers together and switched them to stereo mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5 1 When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for a 2020 iPad 8th gen it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5 s anymore It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4 2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair I figured they had their own connection protocol perhaps wifi 2 4ghz for party mode This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5 1 SECOND ISSUE So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that s the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function But after 15 30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to forget device on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker even using a compatible Bluetooth 5 1 device that they are extremely finicky Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable sound great and look great I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio The current tested Firmware version is 0 8 6 0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed UPDATE I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection perhaps once every two hours or so these have solved all my issues In fact having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement but I love the added functionality I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4 Finally I do not know if it s because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4 2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5 1 in the Charge 5 but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me I have used the 2020 iPad iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me The speaker is easy to pair with Bluetooth Completely portable Sounds great So let start off by I m old school when it comes to selecting speaker I have a massive surround system that sound great I stumbled across the little speaker by accident So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me Now I starting thinking of 2 1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush The Weapon this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation I also played Led Zeppelin s Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long I d like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM FM with USB and SD card In closing don t overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I m sure you ll love too I have found nothing I dislike about this speaker It made me jump when I first connected it to blue tooth with a song And it was only up halfway I took it outside for a real spin so I could see how loud it actually got and OMFG Made my old UE Megaboom look tragic and I was obsesses with that I drew a few neighbors out of their houses to see where the party at and it was just me listening to some quality sound that I didn t even imagine So glad I chose it over the BOSE speaker and it was on a great sale If you love to hear and feel and just get down when you hear that ONE song that means the most to you you want to hear it out of this speaker AKA my new best friend LOOOOOVE I bought this for my fiancé to use for our boat wedding A bluetooth speaker is available on the boat but we don t have any way of knowing how good it is The sound quality is really great it ll be perfect for the wedding and for use in the shop or around the hot tub afterwards This speaker puts out the best music and power you could ever want It s water proof and holds a charge for ever Great buy Upgrading it soon tho but is loud and bassy It s pretty loud and the sound is very clear Good all around sound quality especially on the lower frequencies Midrange is good too Even though i think the Bose has slightly better mid range and high frequency the JBL is a better all round speaker I needed a new biggrt speaker for the garage gym Headphones or my phone speaker wasn t cutting it I also have an older smaller Flip 4 speaker but I wanted something with a little more base and power The size is perfect for my gym needs Based on good experiences with the Flip 4 I expect the quality and durability to last Only time will tell I didn t realize this speaker could be used as a power bank to charge something else That s clever and useful Love the volume and color of course Oh Boy is this item the best This thing is awesome It is super easy to connect to your devices It s portable and the battery lasts FOREVER This is well worth every penny Great portable sound you can take anywhere Quality is fantastic Love the sound I really enjoy listening to my music Easy to carry around Also attractive Connect to bluetooth device playing music and you have instant good quality sound from the JBL speaker The battery life is very impressive as well Easy to use and GREAT to listen to I love my JBL Charge 5 The sound is EXCELLENT Love the sound and range of this JBL charge 5 Can t wait to use on our boat It works great Good sound quality Good quality sounds Works very well Me my wife of 40 years like everything about will order another if something should happen to this one Use it in my work shop and strap it to the roll bar in my jeep very satisfied Took the speaker out of the box and it was 40 charged which was awesome Connected my phone to the speaker and as soon as I started playing music my wife and I looked at each and was like Damn this speaker has great sound 50 volume was loud Don t need it any louder Within 10 minutes we ordered another Charge 5 Highly recommended speaker Now it s time to go to the islands for vacation with the new speakers Sounds great and very convenient Sound and clarity are fantastic This is definitely not a charge 5 I have multiple charge 5 s and what I got is definitely a Chinese knock off Not what I expected to get at all I had a charge 4 then it decided not to hold a charge anymore So I got the charge 5 it s decent but I wasn t super thrilled with the price and the sound quality I received I m a die hard JBL guy I put sound systems in trucks with their products and they are awesome This model was kind of a let down so I purchased a jbl flip 6 same day in person it s pretty good and compares to the charge 5 so then I purchased soundcore boom 2 all received with in 24 hours tested all three and I think the boom 2 is better for sound but the charge 5 is better for taking places I like music when I m working so sound quality is important to me I d say skip the charge 5 get a more expensive model or save money get the flip 6 which is like the charge 5 or get good quality in this speaker bracket by getting the boom 2 for 100 bucks Ps the jbl app to mess with EQ is lacking in customization and barely changes the sounds Honest opinion I spent a lot of money in 24 hours and I choose the boom 2 this go around Maybe JBL will do the charge 5 better next time This is a must have The sound is so beautiful it s exciting Perfect size for portability These are the best portable small speakers out there Last about 10 hours cranked up loud Fast shipping and a lot louder and bigger than I expected which is wonderful in You can take it anywhere and sound is great Battery lasts a long time This little sucker packs a lot of sound Very durable and we take it everywhere 4 day shipping on a 2 day Prime item Great item though These speakers are really good If you purchase you will not be disappointed Great sound In ordered this item for my daughter and she loved it from the color to the sound I will order myself one but different color Battery dies sorta fast but music quality and level are amazing Love the sound this produces Charging is quick I would buy this again No dislikes only likes outstanding sound for its size and price This speaker has amazing sound quality and a battery life to match I might buy more and link them for great outdoor sound I was between a few different JBL speakers but I am glad I got this one The color is super cool and the sound is great Portable to bring with you Unbelievable speaker Beautiful color would highly recommend Like the fact that it floats Awesome Purchase It s a great sounding speaker with awesome bottom end for the size Paired well with my flip 5 Had no issues and the battery lasts a very long time You can also plug in your cell phone to charge it and keep the music going I have this speaker in my workshop and it works great Very loud especially at the beach when nearby Great battery life I need a good volume bluetooth speakerI need to order another one Got this little gem for the wife on her pool side days Now she uses it all the time We replaced a Bose w ipod dock Sound is so very comparable at half the size Great purchase JBL does it again Great Quality Connects instantly every time Bought for travel enjoyed reviews on point blush color Awesome so far Its been working fine Volume seems good and sound is clear Havent had it but a few weeks so we will see CHANGED MY LISTENING LIFE F REVER JAZZ IN FRANCE STREAMS FOR FREE PODCASTS NO WIRE FINALLY JOINED THE LATEST CENTURYWITH A SUPRISED SMILE Midrange sound is in needs of tweekingold boomer with 4000 hz hearing loss NEVER GOING BACK THANK YOU J B L AGAIN and AGAIN I like it I use it with the tv A great value for such a high quality speaker I had prevouly purchased another brand of speaker which was of great quality I paid about double what the charge 5 cost Returned it for one reason and that s because it didn t fit in the same bag with my projector and lapyop I wanted everything in one convenient bag I m so glad I did because n ow everything fits into one convenient bag I saved and still got the same quality sound If you are looking for a qualityblue tooth speaker that won t break the bank look no further I was recently looking for a speaker I could use in the bathroom or outside and not worry about weather I found the jbl charge 5 and it has not disappointed It s extremely easy to use the and connects at the push of the Bluetooth button The sound is robust and I can hear the highs and lows Would definitely reccomend buying Incredible sound quality easily pairs with Bluetooth devices charges VERY quickly and lasts SO LONG It s wonderful It also has an AUX cable input which is extremely important to me Plugging in your device via an AUX cable always sounds better that using Bluetooth Turning it on and off makes a really cool vinyl record sound Turning it on makes a Vinyl record starting to play sound and turning it off makes a Vinyl abruptly stopping sound like the needle has been removed as quickly as possible making a scratch sound Both sound really cool that was a really cool surprise I did not expect it to make those sounds upon turing it on and off The speaker has some weight to it which is nice it feels very well made and IS very well made It s by far the best portable speaker I ve ever owned I ve compared it to the similarly priced BOSE portable speakers and they sound like garbage compared to this I cannot stress enough how amazing the sound quality is and it can get EXTREMELY loud without any distortion The main thing this speaker is made for is music but I ve watched many films on Blu Ray and streaming services All the film audio sounded amazing so much so that I started using this speaker for everything I watch on the TV in my room I run the audio that would normally come out of my TV s speakers through this speaker instead An extremely noticable improvement in the sound of films and television Only thing I would recommend to anyone who gets one of these Beats Pills is to get a protective carrying case I found a great protective hardcase that s custom fit for this exact version of the Beats Pill for around 10 here on Amazon and everything fits like a glove Like I said the speaker does have some weight to it so if you re going to be bringing it around with you everywhere definitely get a case for it Dropping this speaker could potentially destroy it Luckily I ve never dropped mine so I don t know for sure but the case is a must unless you re just going to leave it in your house This is an absolutely wonderful speaker in every way the sound quality is truly amazing I would highly recommend this to anyone who cares about the quality of sound of both music and film television Everyone should care about sound quality but plenty of people don t and just watch and listen to movies television through their phone s speaker and actually listen to music the same way which is just so absurd to me Buy this you will love it Ease of use was very nice This speaker is one of the best ones i have purchased in a long time It sounds great and when i am in the gym with my friends the whole gym could hear the sound like their right next to the speaker It has a little weight to it and it could get frustrating when you are caring it but in all it is a great thing to invest in now some people don t like beats or apple or other top brands But those people do not know what they are talking about This speaker is outstanding Especially if you don t have your battery charger that comes with the speaker you can use any lightening charger from apple to charge the speaker I would recommend this product to everyone I even bought my cousin dad and even my grandma one for christmas and they love it so much I also hear its really nice to have it in the bathroom with you if you like music while being in the bathroom It sounds nice and keeps you company lol I don t really listen to music that much but i listen to beats 1 apple radio all the time and i can t get over how good the music and sound sounds the white one could get dirty pretty quick but all it needs is a few while offs every so often It is also good for audio books as you could be driving or doing other stuff while listening to a book In all the new beats pill plus is a outstanding product and a must buy for teen agers and other grown adults i recommend not buying for children under 10 as it is very easy to crack or break or even get wet They do make cases for the beats pill but you don t really need one Dr Dre and Tim Cook are off to a great start in their company and what i am hearing is they have a bunch of stuff planed for 2016 and beyond Ok so before I bought this speaker I read some of the reviews here and saw mostly positive feedback I know this isn t the absolute best speaker that money can buy but I guess part of me being in my mid 20s rememberers that time when Beats was really cool and holds on to that a little bit Apple acquired the company and that is definitely evident in this product The packaging feels very premium as does the speaker It s heavy and feels really good in the hands with a metal speaker grille and a grippy rubber like material wrapping around It feels like you get what you pay for Now for the important part The sound Again this isn t going to blow away anyone who is a Former DJ or an Audiophile and it shouldn t be expected to This speaker is designed to be used on the deck patio garage etc it has plenty of volume and as long as you don t crank the volume up too high it has pretty good bass for its size So maybe for some people the B logo and a relatively decent sounding speaker isn t worth 130 bucks and I get that but for me it has the right combo of good looks good build quality and just enough bass when it comes to my music that made this a good buy for me My Pill and I have a love affair going on I m an avid music lover and this Pill brings it on home in ANY room Great around the house and the quality of sound is absolutely AMA AAA ZING Family guests are amazed at the sound and swear to buy one for their homes Stick it into a corner or I read in a bag and the sound in amplified and deepened Connects by bluetooth and while I have my own music source I ve had guests connect and play their music too Comes with a lightweight material cover and I understand you can by harder case covers online I travel with it and can t believe how convenient it is It has a little weight to it but I don t mind it I ve been known to have it in my pocketbook streaming music as I shop Everyone greets me with smiles and of course wants to know were it s coming from Charges quickly lasts 8 12 hours I think it s 12 hours max but haven t tried it Easy use of an Apple charger works great even in the car I have several pairs of Beats headphones and an iphone and Macbook so the Beats Pill was a natural buy when I wanted a bluetooth speaker I had wanted one a while but Amazon had the Pill approx 80 off so I went ahead and ordered one I got the special edition Product Red The Pill came very quick within two days on standard free shipping As with any Beats Apple product it was packaged beautifully and securely Comes approx 80 charged Very convenient if you have an iphone as the Pill charges on lightning Battery life is great charged it to 100 and listened for about 5hrs and it is on about 75 now Volume is great the red looks nice I am not a composer or a super music snob but I would say the sound quality is pretty good too Overall I would say if you can get one on sale it is worth it especially if you have an iphone I would say 189 is too much for one if you can get it for about 100 it is not a bad price On sale on Amazon mine was about 105 with tax This is a good quality speaker I spent a lot of time researching a good speaker I am surprised by the quality of sound that comes out of this thing I was leery of Beats in general because I have had nothing but bad experiencesfrom my headphones and earbuds breaking after normal use after only a few months I didn t think I would ever want to buy their product again I decided to try this speaker because of reviews Great speaker for what it is If you are expecting a home theatre stereo sound that isn t going to happen That s not what this speaker nor any speaker like this is made capable of producing What it will do is provide you with what I consider prettydarn good alternative when you need something small andportable The sound quality is rich and clean Not overly basey but base isdefinitely there suitable for a portable speaker It can be turned up LOUD and sound quality doesn t distort for the most part The only reason I didn t give it 5 stars is lack of quality carrying case included There should be better protection provided for a speaker like this Cheap dust pouch does nothing The Pill is a huge improvement from the Pill 2 0 The sound is just on another level from the previous model I also love that this one has some weight to it and doesn t feel like a toy The fact that I can charge it with the same lightning connectors I have around the house is super convenient Apple s design influence and attention to detail are certainly present in this It looks and feels like a premium product It s very easy to set up and the battery life is incredible so far Like others at this price point I expected this to be the successor to the discontinued Pill XL which at lower volumes it does sound just as great and fill the room albeit not as bass y But once you crank the volume there s no comparison to the Pill XL unfortunately If you re expecting comparable loudness bass and overall sound clarity to the XL at high volumes might wanna look elsewhere or hope for a Pill XL in the future The Pill is still very good leaps and bounds above the Pill 2 0 but still not on par with Pill XL I d say it s a good compromise between the big sound of the XL model and portability of the small model Overall I do quite enjoy this speaker and would highly recommend it I can t recommend this item enough It literally survived one of the worst rainstorms I ve seen in the Chicago area in recent years People s basements were flooding and my speaker was outside by my pool where I left it the day before I realized it a day later and it still worked I couldn t believe it The battery life is good and for a small speaker the volume is pretty good as well Highly recommend I normally don t write reviews but I felt that this Product was worth it Originally I had the Bose SoundLink Color II and thought that it was basically the standard when it comes to portable speakers The sound quality was okay and it had a weird issue that would require a hard reset every time it ran out of battery I figure that was how most portable speakers were well I was wrong After I finally had enough of the Bose SoundLink I decided to try out an alternative portable speaker that was in the same price range The Beats Pill was only 15 20 more the SoundLink is around 99 but essentially in the same price range After a few minutes of use I was taken aback by the noticeable difference in quality By comparison the Beats Pill was way better in terms of sound quality look and working features I had always been a supporter of Bose s products however in the portable speakers category the Beats Pill was a hands down the better product Because of the easily perceptible differences in quality for something similar in price I even started questioning whether or not the Bose SoundLink speaker that I had originally bought off of Amazon from Bose was possibly a counterfeit Filipino customer here who want to give knowledge to the readers on how good this product is For starters I m from the Philippines This product isn t available yet in our country so I decided to buy on Amazon It took me almost a month from the moment I bought it on Amazon to receive this product in our doorstep And as soon as I open the balikbayan box the box from a Philippine carrier who holds this package I was astonished Premium Apple packaging like you see on how the iPhones were packed Seeing how this product was packed will give you an intro on how well it is on the inside After I opened it a silly message was on top of the speaker packaging that says Charge me up before you turn me on That message got me excited so I charged it up as soon as got the charger from the box Minutes later I tried to open it and voila a silly sound came up I synced it to my phone and after I played a song I said to myself Thank you God for this wonderful gift That sound that base God it s true music to my ears Maybe others will say Bose is better JBL is a beast and less the cost etc Well honestly I ve never tried one of those before This is the first mini speaker I bought and I ll never regret the day I clicked that Checkout button on Amazon Bought this solely for partying at my beach house this Memorial Day weekend It s perfect size the old BeatsPill was convenient and the XL was just not really convenient unless you only transported it very few to never But this new pill is the perfect size and sound The only thing that is different is obviously it s perfect mid size to move around the house on the deck the porch and the beach The XL just had more bass but honestly who cares I rather be able to hear the lyrics with clarity then the bass of the beat I only mention it because that s the only complaint everyone keeps crying about I think it s sounds quality is up to date with perfection as it get these days and just the right size PLUS I can use it to charge my phone BUT I wish it at least came with a case or something to put it in for going back and forth places Example I bringnit to the beach I don t want sand to get in it so I have to put it in a zip lock bag OTHER then that it bumps Highly recommended let s be serious Beats is the best hands down don t be a hater You ll thank yourself once you get it Just what I needed Soo I ordered the black beats pill I saw a few reviews about fakes but good reviews outweighed the bad heavily so I really wasn t that worried but Literally just received my pill this morning and everything looked good at first but then I noticed my box didn t have the SOUNDS BIGGER THAN ITS SIZE marking on the packaging like seemingly every other model does idk if this is a later model or something that they slightly changed the packaging but thats very suspect to me i watch reviews and unboxings on things like this weeks or months before i purchase them so i know what the packaging is supposed to look like and counterfeiters are only getting better by the day 2nd problem was my pill came with everything except for the little cloth carrying case which was pretty disappointing I planned on purchasing a protective case later but still now once again idk if this could be due to this being a later model due to the pill being out for over 3 years or not It s charging now and once it s fully charged and i play some music i will come back with an update determining whether or not this is a knockoff UPDATE Not a knockoff Love the sound Love the speaker I bought this during the Covid stay at home orders because I began listening to Audiobooks from the library and also spent a lot of time listening to my playlist at home I don t always appreciate having to wear a headset I have an 1800 square foot ranch home and if I am home alone I set this in the middle of the house and can hear it clearly all over the house as I am doing housework I like to take it out on the patio where I spend a lot of time and I can hear it clearly while working in the garden The sound is great and the battery lasts a long time My whole family uses it it is on almost every day The only thing I wish it had was a carrying handle as I move it from room to room and house to patio quite frequently which is why I gave it 3 stars for portability A carrying handle would make it more comfortable to move around It s a lot heavier and larger than the original Pill and Pill 2 0 Because of its size it no longer has that nice grip that the Pill had It doesn t have an out jack for wireless headphone use like the older ones did I m an iPhone user so I liked how the charger used the iPhone cable that way I only need one cable when traveling I dropped it a few times and it held its shape The paint got scratched off a bit on the grill Due to the Panadol shape it s less likely to roll around like the Pill and Pill 2 0 my 2 0 died when it rolled into my sink of dishes RIP The pill is REALLY loud for its size It hurts a bit actually but this is totally fine for party situations on the go Sound quality wise it s definitely mixed oddly in my opinion I listen to anything from Dubstep to Pop to NeuMetal to Rock to GlitchHop to Chiptune to BeeGees to Beatles to Art Blakey to Anime OPs to Hip Hop to Rap I can t say that there s anything in particular that I would have preferred to listen to on the Pill over my headphones but I like to have it for convenience and for laughs My husband bought this speaker for me as an anniversary gift after he knew I had been looking at low price speakers I am SO happy with this gift The sound is phenomenal I listen to a lot of rap hip hop but also children s music with my daughter and other genres as well This baby packs the punch It can be heard throughout our whole house if we turn it loud enough I enjoy the speak phone function in the event that I m multi tasking around the house Super easy to use I ended up buying this one for my 69 year old father who has lost his hearing in his right ear His face when I turned on his favorite doo wop song was unforgettable He was finally able to feel the full immersion musical experience he had been missing for years Definitely heavier than I expected but makes sense when you consider the bass and sound that it can put out Comes with a cloth carrying bag would recommend investing in a real hard shell case if you plan on transporting this to and fro often I love this product and use it on the daily whether while taking a shower hanging outside or jammin in the house Totally worth every penny Beats is a name that has been around for some time now and I had always steered away because items like this were close to the 200 range Not sure if this model is going away and that s why it was as inexpensive as it was but at just over 100 I am very happy with this purchase Not only does this speaker sound great but it takes up very little space I use it while showering in the kitchen to make dinner out on the back patio by the firepit and at the beach Extremely versatile and the battery life is quite impressive Multiple hours on one charge even at full volume The best part about the charger is that it is an i phone charger so a charger for this Beats Pill is never too far away After initially connecting to your Bluetooth it will automatically connect every time after seamlessly The range on the Bluetooth is quite impressive as well Very glad I finally have a portable speaker that works this well Purchased this item for my grandson He loves it I already have one that my ex bought me 13 years ago that s right 13 years ago and it never went bad still holds it s own against anything else so I had to get a second one and bring the heat with them I can combine them and level up my music Wow That could be my whole review but just to put that into context I ve had about 10 portable Bluetooth speakers usually attempting to find the best but cheap well thats what I used to get cheap ones that were the best amount cheap But they just can t keep a charge jbl and take forever to charge and never sounded this good Its able to be loud and powerful And the music sounds better like I can hear more of the songs details not like it s just coming out of 1 speaker or something I love listening to music loud and I haven t even heard this speaker at full volume bc there has been no need Thats crazy to me Soooooo impressedI got the white one bc im bored of black speakers and I just love it but that s personal preference Would buy again but hope I don t need to We have a jambox original that we ve had forever and love One day when we turned it on however it sounded like the speaker was blown After much research I decided to get this to replace it It s a little bit bigger than the jambox but still a nice compact size It charges with a lightning cable which is a nice feature for us but would be a drawback if you re not already using Apple products One day I went to show someone what happened to our jambox and as Murphy would have it it turned on and worked fine I paired both the jambox and the pill to my iPhone so I could switch between the two as I continuously played music and we all agreed the pill had much better sound quality Now even though our jambox works again we always use the beats I was looking for a good speaker that not only had great quality sound but was also made of amazing material The sound is amazing I am no professional musician or anything but for the average consumer the sound is excellent The range is very great as well I can connect from my kitchen to my room which is a good 25 30 ft away and still be able to have a constant reliably connection Battery life is amazing I am a average listener and this can last me on a full charge for about a week The quality and the packaging of the device also makes the speaker feel very premium which beats is known for The design is elegant and sleek making it a perfect addition to a desk or a night stand but it can also be portable Beats have conveniently added a carrying sleeve and even added ports on the back to turn the speaker into a portable charger Over all you cant go wrong with this product if you are looking for a good quality speaker and are a casual listener Part of my job includes giving presentations on a regular basis I wanted a compact blue tooth speaker that could deliver sound throughout an auditorium without a problem I have used this for crowds of up to 200 participants and you can clearly hear it through out the room It does an amazing job The only thing that I don t like is that I have to make sure it s on prior to clicking on a video It will automatically turn off if it s not used during a certain period of time not sure maybe 10 minutes My videos are embedded throughout the presentations so it s not always in use I ve gotten to the point where I remember to make sure it s on before clicking on the video slide but things would flow better if I didn t have to do this I was one of those who own the Pill XL When Apple call for the return of the item I did not wanted to send it back because I was happy with it Good sound bass treble You could even use it for parties with few friends specially when connected to an iPod Nano The sounds was terrific When I saw Apple released the Pill I decided to send it back and bought this Let s be honest it is a good deal I bought the XL for 230 Euros in Paris and got paid back 300 Euros The Pill was just 199 USD out of tax The sound is good Impressive sound for this size Indeed it is smaller can be carried easily than the XL I also found the treble better the bass is OK but that is the problem It is just OK when we compared it to the XL there are so many things we miss No way of having it in a room when you have more than 10 15 people talking what the Pill XL would do without sweating Oh One other thing the application It is probably the first time I delete an Apple made application It is useless The only thing it seems to be made for is to make you buy a second Pill and I do not want to buy another one I found it a little bit exaggerate as a marketing strategy To sum up if you are looking for a good wireless audio thing that is the Pill to buy If you are looking for something to replace your Pill XL Think again Just got this today and so far so good Extremely easy to set up and sounds great I went into a store to compare the sound of a few different comparable speakers and this one had the crispest sound and voice clarity After seeing a bunch of reviews of comparison via youtube where they liked the other models better I have to say you might want to go in and listen for yourself Everybody hears and likes something different I like very clear crisp sound and this speaker delivers that over the other ones I listened to This one is also all enclosed and gives the ability to charge something while this is plugged in and I m assuming while it is on battery mode It s just an all around clear crisp compact weighty well made speaker My amazon order got lost in shipping but I did buy these from another retailer I purchased 2 and pairing with my iPhone And ipad was a snap The app making them work in stereo is easy to users well These were a nice upgrade from my old bose speaker for the price The sound quality is better than my old nose speaker but it s not as good as the newer speakers but for the price and ease of use it was it was a good deal Don t get me wrong these speakers do sound good I am just a music nut and am pretty picky about sound quality I am satisfied with them aster having them for a month now I gave this to my wife as a gift She uses it with her iPod Touch and has it set up in the kitchen so she can jam while her culinary creativity is flowing I m pretty impressed with the sound especially considering how dinky the speakers are I had my doubts when I bought this but it sounds pretty good a lot of response across the entire frequency range maybe a little bass heavy but like I said pretty impressive for a couple of tiny speakers I adore the speaker I missed the boat on the original beats pill which I was sad about but when I heard they were coming out with the beats pill plus I immediately jumped on the wagon this pairs incredibly easy with your device especially if it s Apple it doesn t have the same pairing ability as AirPods or Powerbeats pro where you get a prompt on your Apple device and boom your paired it just pears easier with Apple devices then I would think an android you can still have the seamless transfer from one Apple device to another which is much appreciated Yesterday I wrote a frustrated review saying I couldn t get it to charge no matter what but today I am changing my tune Then it occurred to me to try using the wall plug instead of the USB cord to the computer and it worked perfectly Prior to that I had gone on the website for help and they suggested resetting the device which I also did press the power button and hold for 3 seconds Not sure if that also helped The sound quality and volume are great It s sometimes hard to pair it with the computer for watching movies That and the recent trouble with charging are the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 After 3 years of constant use a lot of travel use next to water couple splashes and drops it stills working perfectly Definitely one of the best products that beats has dropped As far as sound quality goes it was awesome Battery life was great The only flaw was the sound control We like to listen to music when we go to bed and it was impossible to find a happy medium between soft and loud Low was too low and the next up was too loud Seemed odd to have such a jump between volumes Ended up returning it because of this I really wanted to like it I would definitely recommend this to anybody interested in music or who listens to music on a daily basis This speaker has the best sound quality I ve ever heard from a Bluetooth speaker It is however very easy to accidentally damage After normal use the Product Red finish began to scrape off of mine Apple was quick to replace it for me then after a drop of about 4 feet the new speaker was dented and finish was scraped off in spots I definitely think if Apple makes a new version there should be something protruding further than the outer case to prevent damage to the main parts of the speaker The Beats PiLL or whatever is okay It s not bad by any means But there s no way it s worth this amount of money First of all it s not even as tall as a bottle of beer or soda No matter what the electronic mojo they try to pull you just can t defeat physics Beats is known for having pretty heavy bass I have the Beats Studio headphones Those things are A MAZ ING Holy moly they re great Based on the reputation of those headphones I had high hopes for this portable speaker Again it s not bad but you just can t get past the fact that the thing is small You re not going to get huge room filling sound from something this size To reiterate it s not bad at all It actually sounds pretty decent For the money though there have to be better options I bet BOSE has something that sounds at least as good but costs less Or maybe costs 20 more but sounds twice as good If you re devoted to Beats this gets a three star it s okay rating I would have happily paid a little more to get a better unit though This is such an improvement over the first generation Beat s Pill I particularly like going into stereo mode with two of them and was surprised at how well the sound covers an area like my living room or garage shop when I m out working on projects The base response is also really nice Going stereo requires an iPhone 6 or newer and an app free from Apple to join the speakers It can be a little cranky making the connection a minor thing just be patient but the sound is well worth it I ve always wanted a beats pill so I knew I had to get one Definitely paying for the brand more than the sound The sound is decent Turned up loud enough and the speakers go bad like it can t handle the volume This is a very sensitive speaker A couple of hits and dings and you might find yourself looking up Beats Pill back lights not working or something like that Overall it s a good 4 5 Probably could get a cheaper speaker with better sound Just got my BEATS PILL and used it last night to watch football and hear the game in surround sound I don t use cable so watching ESPN on my phone the phone s speaker is not great so this was a much needed upgrade Improvement Even plugged phone into speaker to charge phone while watching the game If you re looking for a awesome speaker and totally worth the money BUY THIS ONE And hard case for it is 10 12 dollars and will protect your speaker I had a BoseMini that stoped working after 3 years I am a fan of Beats and decided to get this product instead of ordering another Bose Overall it s a great portable speaker and capability to charge other devices definitely adds value into it It has a long battery life and you can have it use for long time until requiring charge but sound quality isn t the best Although serves the Purpose and I suggest it base on price This portable Bluetooth speaker is a dream I use it when playing TomPlay music on my iPad There adjustable volume is great Don t expect it to fill a large room It works great in a smaller setting It is easy to charge and connected to my iPad 12 with ease It is durable and you can tell by the weight it is a well built device It works great with audio books as well I use this EVERYWHERE from camping to car washes Water shooting towards it the SUPER hot sun on it while playing and it s still going I like LOUD and this is the smallest speaker I ve used that reaches the volume and bass I crave I stay in campgrounds a lot and have to be careful I m not bothering others with it near full volume I got it on sale so I m REALLY happy with this purchase Doesn t lag when using bluetooth like my Anker s did Doesn t hurt the charger is compatible with my iPhone either After loving this speaker for a few months I felt compelled to leave a review A lot of wonderful bark coming from these little puppies You can feel the heft but still very portable in a back pack I listen to lots of Jaxx old and new school Hip Hop Reggae and Afrobeat these genres sound wonderful on the Pill However the pill somehow convinced me to conceive all over again so I bought a second Pill to pair I haven t tested it out yet but looking forward to seeing what they can do in tandem I ve had the pill for about a week now and LOVE it I was debating between this and the UE Boom 2 and am very happy with my choice as I like just bringing my lightning cable phone and pill with me and not having to worry about an extra mini usb cable also The form factor is awesome and the all black looks sexy Sound quality is on point I ve used this outside by the beach with waves rolling in and I can still hear it crystal clear Been listening to a lot of Kygo lately too and the bass sounds even better than on my car Been listening to Beats 1 radio a lot on this and just super stoked If you get this you won t be disappointed This is an excellent speaker I ve had it for over three years and it hasn t given me any problems it sounds great There are skins you can customize these speakers with to make it unique I bought two and both still work great Also bought a case for storage Would definitely recommend for a gift or yourself Amazing little box The sound quality is exactly what I was after Crisp and good bass Easy to turn on and off and if you leave it on and forget to turn off it ll remember to turn off and disconnect from Bluetooth for you But the key was excellent sound quality Highly recommend for this form factor Not to mention the white one is very stylish Speaker was awesome and audio quality is amazing I bought it so I could here music while driving a tractor and it was definitely worth the buy I could hear the engine noise but still hear the music flowing through the speaker I greatly recommend this to anyone Update April 29 2021 speaker still works great its in really poor condition from me dropping it off heights trailers its been in water but the it just doesn t wanna die will definitely buy another one when the one I have passes This was a gift for my husband makes 3 in our house The sound quality is just amazing Battery lasts a long time and it s very portable It s gone with us many places and it s on its way to the beach Highly recommend great product Love that I was able to get a better price on the black one I love it I bought the JBL Charge 4 and I returned it because the battery stopped charging after 3 weeks and the sound wasn t very good I decided to try out the Beats Pill and the sound quality is so much clearer than the JBL Not to mention it s way more aesthetically pleasing than the JBL I definitely recommended getting one of these My CD player in my SUV doesn t work so I purchased a beats pill to play music on Let me tell you I am SO glad I did It works great I love how easy it is to use and I can control everything from my iPhone Good product and great investment It comes with a really nice charger which doubles as an iPhone charger if need be The white carry case included works great for carrying my beats around Especially when I toss it in my purse it s great for protecting my beats from dust Oh and I can t forget to mention the sound quality is EXCELLENT If you re considering a convention coordlees speaker with exceptionally good battery life buy this one This is my first Pill Has a nice sound and easily pairs with new ish devices had an issue connecting with an older fire tablet It is an apple device so it uses the same charger as current apple products It quickly charges and holds charge for a long time even when regularly used Only downside is the portability of this I don t just want to toss it in my backpack so I recommend ordering the carrying case to keep it safe when traveling This was a gift for my son he loved it and shipping was super fast I love the sound portability and the smallness of The Beats Pill When I turn up the volume you can hear it clearly up and downstairs I have it loud because it sounds amazing Best purchase I ve made in a long time Easy to get it playing right away Yes I highly recommend Beats Pill This speaker produces great sound for music and the spoken word It very easily paired with my Samsung television Absolutely the loudest I love it This speaker really gets loud I have the Beats Pill 2 0 the first one and it was great and didn t give me any problems but I wanted the newer one bc it wasn t loud enough so I ordered it last week It finally arrived yesterday after some shipping delays but it was well worth the wait I set it up and now I m enjoying it the battery last longer the sound is much clearer the pill XL lives up to all the good reviews I like the design better and it s almost twice the size of the other pill I just love it Great productI been using for a few months and sounds like a big bass speaker better than boss or jbl used by close friends when hanging out at the patio Really love the sound and the easy syncronising with my work iPhone and my personal androidIt s worth it I received this last Friday and I ve already bought another one The sound quality you can t beat literally haha especially for the price I got it in white and it s so beautiful I had honestly never heard of this brand of speaker before but I m so glad Amazon had it advertised on my homepage I m beyond impressed with everything I have a lot of different speakers this is definitely my favorite and it s one of the cheapest ones I have bought It truly blows my mind I couldn t be happier with my purchase Horrible at precise sound control One click on this thing effectively doubles the sound at low volume so getting that level juuuuuuuuuuuust right at work is impossible The sound adjustments are not smooth That is incredibly disappointing Like it increments sound in some percentacge wtf Dre LolAlso thanks for the cheap metal speaker covers Protective yes From the 30 s Yes Its 2019 use better materials Some places they went cheap others they went all out on Speaker needs work The app is useless as well Update You cannot have an audio jack plugged in and be connected to bluetooth at the same time Im disappointed and if I can find one that ll do what I want more control over volume better interface options Sad Yet another update The button to skip forward play or pause is too stiff There is no descernable click or acknowledgedment that the speaker has done what you want so one will hit the button twice to skip a song instead only one button press will register and the speaker will pause So i have to play by pressing once then skip by pressing twice The whole evolution goes something like this I need to skip a song so i press the button twice only one registers and the song stops Need to play first before skipping so hit the button once song plays then hit the button twice tada The thing you wanted And all for 125 bucks If I hadnt thrown away the packaging i would return this POS Love this speaker it s tough sounds great connects to my phone instantly whenever I turn it on and is very loud Still holds charge and doesn t miss a beat definitely recommend I would def make the purchase again It is a crisp sound but honestly it isin t as loud as my old jbl flip 5 which is why I give this 4 stars very sturdy speaker have dropped it multiple times and it still sounds good I love my beats pill it is compact but the sound is amazing I did learn it will pair faster if you are playing music that has been downloaded to your phone or tablet This item is great if you don t have a lot of room or if you don t want to invest in a stereo and you can t take your stereo with you I love this is portable I highly recommend this product I bought this speaker after buying a cheap speaker That one broke after 90 days I love how loud this speaker can sound I am a trucker and use it in my truck You get what you give I mean if you buy cheap knockoffs They are going to break down sooner And waste more money One of my best Amazon purchases It s genuine Beats and after an initial two hour charge I linked it to my iPhone X and it sounds amazing I can hear the music throughout the first floor of my house and I didn t even turn it up all the way My only suggestion is to buy the white Beats Plus because the red one is 50 more for some reason If you get this you ll love it I ve had other Bluetooth speakers before but this is hands down the best for the price I use this sounds system almost everyday The sound is very good Absolutely no static The music fills the entire room like a surround sound I also use the pill for conference calls so I can multiple task In addition to the Pill is used when watching movies on my phone has excellent sound for movies This is a great speaker for the price It has good sound quality and volume for the size Battery life is also really good This speaker is especially useful for me as an iPhone user because it uses the same type of Lightning port as my phone to charge which means I only need to bring one type of cable when I travel with it It also has an USB A port to charge my phone acting like a battery pack The best bluetooth speaker around as far as portability and base quality Once I got it charged and working I used it when I was watching Netflix movies on my Apple computer I am very hard of hearing and often the words are far too soft for me to hear with full volume on the p c I used this and I could hear what was being said So far so good it is helping me hear It s awesome for the money I paid for it 130 even would have paid a little more Now I see them going for over 400 and I just can t justify that in my head My new Beats Pill is a marvel in audio engineering and design It s feel and weight alone let a purchaser know that she he has a quality product in hand Set up is simple and direct and leads to a near instant listening experiences Sound quality is close to perfect and much higher than one would expect from such a small unit I would recommend the Pill to anyone I think this is a great little speaker for it s size It s a great upgrade over the speakers in my laptop Easy to move it around to wherever you re at and take it with you too Easy to operate syncs right up to computers or phones at least the Apple one s I use I bring this speaker everywhere with me I bring it when I shower or when I go anywhere Once I left it outside and I lost it It rained on and off for about a week and I eventually rediscovered it and I found that it was still in perfect condition I have had it for about three years and the sound quality and battery life are still extremely strong I love it Me and my husband love it Had first generation of Beats Pill So upgrading to this was awesome The look is better It s heavy Good battery life so far I bought this beats pill after giving away my Bose sound link 2 I thought my Bose was a good speaker and would get the job done delivering great sound until I got this one I did a side by side and the beats delivers 10X better It s more crisp clear and louder It made the Bose sound muffled when comparing them The beats are definitely designed to deliver sound I would recommend the beats pill to all ages I am 69 years old and I love this speaker it sounds like my old school stereo with big speakers I can t say enough about it and I have to have it loud when I play my music you would not regret getting it I would have put a picture of it but not very good with computer thank you oh and I got the red one and it wasn t expensive I had this for over a year great sound quality It works great if you are looking for great sound at Wireless Speaker be aware that if you are looking for a monstrous sound you can hear your music at 50 yards away this speaker is not for you but if you enjoy the music and you are looking for a great quality sound then this speaker is for you and it is a great option Sounds great It has good sound It gets pretty loud Depends on your sound preference though of course Good for a gathering I recommend the beats pill Update The device is not waterproof I have a cat and she knocked it over into the dogs water bowl It was not in there long at all Since then I have left it in a bag of rice for a week now And it does not work or charge I have had this bluetooth speaker from a year ago it s been great it s a walmart product I had got this beats pill because I felt like I was getting enough bass So now that I got this neat pill I barely turn it up and it s amazing I cant complian I actually recommend getting this if you enjoy cruising on your bike and bumping them tunes This is the one to get for sure Doesn t go as loud as I d hoped and it barely has any bass at all I guess this speaker is ok for a group of 8 11yr olds who are practicing for the school talent show in an empty parking lot however aside from the durability of the physical product this speaker is NOT worth more than 40 because I ve bought an off brand speaker FOR 40 and although it currently is broken and will randomly shut off AND is no longer particularly wireless since it no longer works when it s unplugged That broken generic speaker is STILL a Better box than this Beats speaker and that s sad I was gonna return it but because I have such a bad history with electronics breaking headphones speakers tablets etc and me having NO Back up I ve decided to just try out a Bose speaker but keep this Beats speaker on deck as a back up in case the Bose shorts out or something But otherwise I hate to say it but I wouldn t recommend this product This speaker is priced wayyyyy too high for the overall quality of the sound to be this bad I am writing this review after using the product for 2 years and I can with complete assurance say it ll be one of your best purchases Very portable good battery capacity and most importantly rich sound Beats is simply the best Amazing I ve always bought products by Beats I had the original beats pill when it first came out but the sound quality with this new one is insane Compared to the later addition it is so much more louder and crisp Bass is awesome and it s a vibe for sure Battery life is great Overall highly recommend purchasing it Worth the money This is hands down one of the best portable speakers on the market Small but powerful sound I could even here it well on the 2nd floor of my house when I left it in the kitchen downstairs The only hung my son requested for Christmas I price shopped for several weeks before finally ordering from Amazon My son is over the moon happy with this I was surprised how substantial it felt I m used to cheap plastic that will crack if dropped from a few feet This speaker feels like it will last My son said the sound quality is amazing and I will attest that I can hear feel the bass from across the house and through several floors This product is great Came in the actual beats pill professional looking box came with a beats charger and a beats wall plug in and the pill was rapped up in all of its original packaging The sound quality is great just like the beats headphones as well I have no complaints It s also great because the pill charges with ANY iPhone charger It can also charge your phone I LOVE IT The Beats Pill sound is great bass is great loud like it should be and charges pretty good Bluetooth works well even audio cord which not included but I have one beats studio 3 cord so its compatible but you may hear static etc details overall works and recommend to anyone This Pill has some serious weight to it It has great build quality and the sound is excellent I do notice at times it can be a bit heavy on the bass but that is to be expected on Beats products It gets quite loud and stays pretty distortion free If you are looking for something to use on the go this would be a great addition Love this speaker to life Dr Dre is the best and his speaker doesn t fall short from his greatness not by an inch All the others don t nearly stand in the same league as this speaker when it comes to sound quality and size lol I d buy five more than a huge inconvenient speaker if i want to throw a huge party After my first generation beats pill started to age I needed a new speaker I can carry to the tennis courts I love the look but at the same time I love the battery life after a long day of tennis the battery only went down one level The sound is good could be louder The portability is amazing The sound quality is crisp and clear Delivers a great amount of base for a speaker of its size The battery life is one of the best batteries I ve seen in a speaker On top of that it does not take long to charge The size of it makes it easy to travel with The pill shaped speaker fits well in a backpack suitcase and etc I thought it would be louder So a little disappointed but the sound is nice battery life is amazing and it s portable I just wanted something booming for my backyard parties This speaker is very easy to use with only three or four steps The sound quality is superb at all volume levels The case is sturdy and the whole unit has substantial weight so it will stay put wherever it s placed It synchs easily via Bluetooth with my iPhone to play music from Pandora and to interact with phone calls The Beats Pill is a high quality portable speaker OK so I was pretty skeptical at first but I think that sound is a personal preference so I actually went to a retail store to listen to a few of the portable Bluetooth speakers for my iPhone before settlingon the Beats Pill I like the size of it in my hand as I carry it around it s large enough to dispense decent sound yet small enough to be easily portable The Beats Pill esp has good bass which is important to me and the sound is rich There will always be better and more expensive ones but this portable speaker works great Worth a very good sales price as all things are over priced The sound is great but not going to give you an amphitheater sound which is insane to think put in the right spot in a corner or nook area and it really adds to the dynamic s Very good sound However the stereo mode using two speakers only works with a mobile device computer can connect to only one speaker and requires a cumbersome connection process every time you want to use them I am returning a second pill I just bought but as a single speaker it is very good Sound quality is reasonable I use the device in my off grid one room cabin to play music from my Spotify library Battery life is good and I have an Anker charger to keep it going As a portable sound system it is fine Ok so this speaker is good lets hit it out rn but if your a bass head you will not be as impressed it keeps the bass enough but not as plenty as the jbl but mid range is marvelous with the material exquisite tho you dont have water protection tho i would give this speaker an 8 1 out of ten I didn t receive everything listed in the description I charged it for 3 1 2 hours and it worked for 5 seconds and said it was dead So I charged it overnight and tried it again Same thing If I could give this negative stars I would I had no clue what this was it was on my son s Christmas List He was so excited when he opened his gift on Christmas Day I am amazed by the sound quality in this tiny device We use it all the time even outside Definitely worth the money And your teen will love you forever Needed a new portable speaker for the home setup and once I saw that Beats read Apple came out with the new Beats Pill I bit the bullet and purchased one First things first the unboxing experience and the design of the speaker is quintessentially Apple Speaker has a nice heft to it and the design of the speaker is really nice with the angled design and the speakers facing you If you are in the Apple Ecosystem this speaker was made for you as it connects to your iPhone the minute you turn it on with a very satisfying screen animation I m told you can easily connect with an Android product too but I didn t have one in hand to test out how easy it was The sound quality of this speaker is really great for its size living up to the Beats name filling the room with punchy bass and crystal clear sound Rated IP67 meaning it is dust and water resistant so you can feel confident taking it to your next beach party or when you are traveling Battery life of this thing is stated at a whopping 24 hrs I ll definitely be testing that claim but if true is completely mind blowing But what sets this speaker apart and one of the main reasons why I bought it is that it also doubles as a speakerphone I can connect this badboy to my laptop and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work And when I m done with my calls since it is connected to my laptop via USB C I can listen to lossless music on Apple Music Mind blown Run don t walk to buy this awesome speaker So I m super picky about sound and have spent a decent amount of money over the years finding good speakers I was currently using the B O Bluetooth speaker which is really good and is a bit more money than this Prior I had Bose and some of other brands Compared to all of them this is an amazing speaker for the price point Bass is great Clarity is great Build quality is great You can even hook it up via usb c to get lossless music I didnt notice much a difference that way Also if your in the apple eco system it works like AirPods where you can switch between devices and also locate the speaker via find my Note I have also tried both of the newest beats over ear headphones and hated them so I was surprised that this was as good as it is I really like the new Beats Pill 2024 speaker The sound quality is amazing with great bass and clear vocals It s small stylish and easy to carry around which is perfect for when I m on the go The battery lasts a long time even with heavy use and connecting it to my devices with Bluetooth is super easy The design looks good and fits well with any room or setup The only downside is that there isn t an app to control the speaker It would be nice to have an app to adjust settings check battery life and manage connections Even without this the Beats Pill 2024 is a fantastic speaker that I highly recommend I love the size weight and quality of my Pill It delivers good deep base and enhances my listening beautifully I recommend this speaker to anyone who loves music and true sound The Beats Pill 2024 has made a triumphant comeback Here s what stands out Sound Quality The audio is crystal clear with balanced mids and highs The bass is punchy yet smooth making it great for various music genres Design The new Pill features a stylish everything proof design Connectivity Amplify and Stereo modes allow pairing two Pill units for stereo music Overall the Beats Pill 2024 is worth the wait I own several portable speakers Bose JBL and these are my favorite I love how well it integrates with iPhone and sounds great Pretty cool how it can charge your phone and vice versa The controls feel premium and very worth the price My original Wonderboom finally gave up so I bought the Beats Pill I was blown away by the balanced sound for all genre of music Bass is well balanced with Treble and does not try to be more than what a small speaker can do Very impressed and highly recommend this speaker This 2 pound speaker sounds insane for its size It s almost as loud as my jbl Xtreme 2 At lower volumes the music is balanced and you can hear details in the notes that definitely sound high fi and high end Well worth 150 better yet buy two for 300 I bought this because it was on sale and I always wanted a beats pill I am a JBL user and firmly stand by their quality and sound Does this compete with Flip 6 Absolutely Does it compete with Charge 4 or 5 Definitely not Heres whySound i purchased the Black Pill right out of the box it is versatile in the sense it matches anything you have I could ve went with Champagne as well and would ve also fit I compared to flip 6 right away it is Brighter crisper and deeper bass at 50 volume and lower However at above 50 the bass becomes muddy it has this weird flutter sound to it The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50 and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers The pill is definitely very portable great performance and most definitely great value for the money Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV Great product also very sturdy it survived a drop with only a little cosmetic damage Otherwise it works great and is loud with alot of bass I have been using the beats pill 2024 for the last couple of days and it has been a really good sounding speaker It outclasses other speakers in the price range and even few of the larger party speakers The volume of this speaker is mind blowing though it might be bit harsh in a closed room Bass is absolutely great and overall the speaker is very balanced It is worth every penny This speaker has incredible sound and bass for its size In fact it sounds much better than my Sonos Roam 2 and JBL Flip 6 which the latter I ve always considered a good sounding speaker The microphone is a great addition for calls You won t be disappointed with this speaker Thinking about buying another to pair in stereo I wish they had an app for this Beats speaker with EQ The Pill app doesn t seem tonairj with the new Pill Update purchased another to pair in stereo Incredible sound This was a gift for our grandson for his 17th birthday He loves it It has great sound and he s really enjoying it Excellent sound and clarity even at the highest volume Great sound Very easy to connect and great sound quality Perfect for gifts and around the house The sound is great for the size and the battery life is great It sounds better than a jbl flip6 it has excellent sound quality It s just perfect Compact sound is awesome Good overall sound quality Returned the soundcore motion 300 for this one I think this was a well done refresh great quality decent bass and simple interface The new pill looks awesome and built extremely well The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats However with this being said the performance is only half of what I hoped the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note which is sad because pill doesn t have an eq in its app at all the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines mids are clear and neutral highs are clear and crisp without any harshness and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it s mostly just mids and highs They seriously could ve added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here All this and the package arrived with the box already opened not too excited about my purchase Sounds fantastic with no connection issues Very happy with purchase worth it the purchase a 100 porcent Sounds amazing It s not bad at lower a volume it s not good at max but it s loud with no bass and the call I had to shout lol it needs a up date Too much bass and voice distorts on full Volume I find Earfun Uboom L is better If you try to use Siri you have to be right next to the speaker it deflex Siri from the phone So if you re cooking and your phone is next to you and you say Siri what time Is it and the speaker is on the other side of the room it won t work because she won t be able to hear you because her ears are the speaker Randomly turns on and off after 30 to 40 minutes of use As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer you won t be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy That s fine for songs that complement that kind of sound but is a determent to anything else For example listening to an audio book it doesn t sound very good and I actually prefer my phone s built in speaker or a regular set of headphones There is no EQ feature even if you download the Beats app Speaking of the Beats app it doesn t really have any use It will tell you battery life and remind you what the controls are but that s it The one touch connect feature did not work I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings Android Samsung Galaxy S20 FE For controls there are four buttons A power button multi function button play pause next previous volume down and volume up They are the same color as the speaker do not light up and are difficult to see I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button However if you don t hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator hold it too long it goes into pairing mode You have a 2 3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off Volume wise it does get pretty loud Loud enough to hurt if you re nearby Bass of course travels well and far be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy Not great for apartments because of that at least if you don t want to be that annoying neighbor If you have two of these you can sync them together either to just make them even louder why would anyone want that It already hurts at max volume or as a stereo pair For the price I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor I own a plethora of bluetooth speakers one even costing 10x this one But for a small portable form factor this pill doesn t sound half bad It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department but the portability factor makes it a keeper Right now I m testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam Highs are clear mids are punchy bass is present but it won t knock your socks off If you re looking for a balance between portability and sound quality then this might be your ticket at 150 BUT if you want better sound quality save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger even much larger speakers that will SA MOKE this one but you WILL sacrifice portability One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet Two cats and two GSD s you GSD owners out there know the struggle It will not wipe clean with your hand but a very damp paper towel works like a charm This is a very small and compact speaker but for its size it packs a serious punch It s comparable to the JBL Flip 6 Sure that speaker has even better bass but this more complete package for its price with speakerphone and in my opinion more sexy design The bass is great and the overall mid and high range is excellent but I wouldn t say it s the best among portable speakers This is overall a very bass heavy speaker I only own the black one but I m interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one because it s sexy af This is definitely the best looking and sleekest portable speaker It s minimal smooth and easy to carry around Sure for the price you can argue that you can get a better speaker but what this speaker offers is a well rounded package nice sound with great bass goes well with home decor without sticking out and minimal with a beautiful design It s especially easy to access if you re an Apple user Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times Even though it says 24 hours of battery life take it with a grain of salt The fact is the higher the volume you play the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds So don t complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised lol I play around 60 70 volume range and very bass heavy songs so I get about 6 1 2 hours from what I observed Yours might vary The biggest critique I have is that it s the worst sounding speaker if you go above 80 volume The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful The higher the volume the less bass you ll hear and the highs and mids kick in instead To be fair most small speakers are like this anyways The best volume range I found is 30 70 especially 60 which produces the most balanced bass and highs In conclusion if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound then this is for you By the way don t even compare this to the JBL Charge 5 It literally has different usage and the size difference is there lmao A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass LMAO So yeah it s kind of like comparing apples to pears lmao I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers Beats Pill 2024 is a high quality product from the Apple esque packaging to the incredible sound output from this small tiny Bluetooth speaker Incredibly easy to use connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can albeit longer It has a pre attached teather that seems strong enough Claims to be IP67 water resistant It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB C charging cable USB C YAY They claim the battery life is 24 hrs and it may well be as we ve been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it s still going strong I tested it via Bluetooth mainly streaming via Apple Music and or it s size it packs quite a punch Decent mids and highs and it has bass Not tons of bass expected for it s size it s just physics but it s decent if not exceptional given the size of this but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product and this one doesn t disappoint Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music It s easy to control there are four buttons power button multi function button play pause next previous volume down and volume up I really like It also has a built in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well and it works pretty good In summary for the price compared to other party speakers around the same price class the Pill punches far above it s weight class feature sound clarity with decent bass lots of volume and simplicity in design as we ve come to expect from Beats While maybe not the cheapest party speaker out there it is among one of the best if not the best in it s price class Look don t tell Dr Dre this but I really wanted a new Beats Pill as my dedicated shower speaker Just something I can set on the shelf by the shower and jam out to without worrying about it getting wet I misplaced my old one years ago and I always liked the pill shaped form factor Fast forward to 2024 and we have a brand new Beats Pill that is redesigned from the old model You still get the pill shape but now there s some nice updates like the lossless type C listening improved bass drivers and larger battery capacity about of days worth of Beats now The packaging and design are definitely exquisite it is an Apple product and it shows in the design and style There s support for both Apple and Android too which is nice Sound quality is superb as expected too Sharp highs and nice thick booming bass It definitely leans to a heavier bass sound which is fine as the end result is still really balanced and crisp The verdict A triumphant return for the Beats Pill Beats has long been popular for producing audio products headphones earbuds speakers and so on with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of boosted bass notes In that case this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do either Apple or Android phones that gets VERY loud with VERY rich boosted bass The audio is also clear for things like spoken word so that s a positive overall Outside of that the Pill is water resistant not waterproof so don t drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm but it s okay probably if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat meaning that it s great for outdoor parties given the volume and has solid battery life I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank charging phones if you need to It s not the primary function but it s nice to see manufactures add value added extra functionality that doesn t require any extra accessories or things to carry along The Pill appears to be very well built and should prove quite durable As an added bonus all the packaging is recyclable kudos to Beats on that So if you like your music loud and bass heavy then this is the wireless speaker for you If that s the case give it a try today First this was an amazing find All of our headphones are Beats and the boomboxes JBL so this is a first for me Let me start by saying this beat pill sounds amazing and better than my bigger than the pill jbl Is worth every penny I love listening to music and I always need a speaker close by I even wear headphones to work because I need music This little pill sounds amazing even in the open patio This is def my new favorite speaker Highly recommend I bought this speaker off of Apple online in the statement red The color is beautiful and the sound it puts out is amazing Lots of sound packed in a small speaker The size of the speaker is slightly smaller than I anticipated but it does not reduce the amount of sound that comes out if it The speaker s texture is smooth and the red is very eye popping Super easy to link to my phone I was able to get it up and running within a minute The buttons are very intuitive The charge head is on the back which allows us to continue using the speaker while it s being charged Charge time is relatively short and battery lasts for hours I love that there s an auto power down feature so the batter doesn t drain when you forget to turn off the speaker With any product that is this new it s difficult to tell how enduring the battery life will be over the months and years Thus far the performance has been amicable and I m pleased with how the sound from this modestly sized speaker fills my living room Even outdoors the sound carries but doesn t blow out everything else around it I ve had plenty of bluetooth speakers over the years and this one is near the top for most important factors such as sound quality battery life connectivity and water resistance It s a perfect little beach speaker Connects immediately with mine and my spouse s Android phones can t say for iPhones I have always been a fan of Beats products and they are well known for being high quality so this newest version of the Beats pill did not disappoint It sounds great it can get very loud for just a small little speaker and has very clear sound with exceptional bass woofer It has a long battery life charges very quickly and an updated USB C charging port It also comes with a code for a free trial of Apple Music and the option to add Apple Care and the option to add it to Find My device through Apple I am kind of a music snob so I am pretty picky with speakers For the size of this thing I am not sure I could ask for better I have a list of songs that I listen to on any new speakers or headphones that I get I want to hear every note from every instrument and the vocals I want every thing to be be crisp and clear If I cant adjust my eq to make that happen different songs have different settings then I dont keep it This little speaker just sounds good I have had beats products before and was happy with them This is probably my favorite It is super easy to connect to my samsung s24 ultra As soon as I turned it on a notification showed on my phone asking if I wanted to connect it It sent me to the play store to download the app for it and then I was listening to music Super easy to connect Looks great I have the red one Sounds really good Definitely 5 stars Love the Beats Pill Easily connected to my Android Pixel 7 Pro via Bluetooth Good battery life Lightweight very easy to carry to different rooms or garage wherever you are working hanging out I like the stylish but minimalist look Got the tan so it wouldn t show dust like black would the red looks great but I wanted a speaker to sit on a bookshelf and not stand out too much It is great that it works with both Android and iOs I have music and audio books on both my iPad and Pixel 7 Pro phone so this is very convenient Highly recommended Use this for multiple purposes Sound is great loud and better then other speakers I have used The speaker is not very bassy but for my purpose that is fine The duration of the battery is good also I have ran it for a few hours before it started to disconnect and reconnect due to lack of power Over all I will be recommend this to friends and family I almost don t even know how to describe how good this speaker sounds 100 watts is crazy for this small of a speaker It sounds so good The base is deep and the sound is smooth Really great quality and it s definitely durable I love the silicone base as I have small children It s been picked up and dropped a few times lol It connects to all of my devices no problems An investment in a high quality speaker that will last for years definitely worth every penny This Bluetooth speaker has surprisingly good sound for a portable speaker The bass is even pretty good punchy just a little muddy sounding but better than other brands I ve used I like the clean matte black look though the silicone does attract a lot of dust So far the battery life and range seem good This speaker excelled my expectations It is bug enough to play loud but small enough to store easy and travel We used it at birthday parties and the beach and it was perfect for both Great sound and did not take up any space traveling So glad i got this 100 recommend The beats pill has a strong legacy This 2024 model is the best yet It does everything Yes it has a mic Yes it can charge your phone Yes IT HAS LOSSLESS AUDIO THROUGH USB C Yes it is extremely loud but crisp The bass is amazing It has an easy interface with iPhones It s cheap And yes it s waterproof and sand and dustproof This Bluetooth speaker is on the higher end of the price range for a small form factor speaker Priced similarly to the JBL Extreme 2 which I also have the sound quality is about the same Which is to say very good for a small speaker Compared to the JBL the Beats Pill is Not as loudHas a slightly better sound quality Slightly smallerDoes not have a carrying strap which you can also use to hang the speaker Pairs automatically with Apple devices and can be tracked using Find MyBoth offer multiple speaker pairing My biggest complaint about the Pill is that there are just not enough buttons There is no dedicated power button and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off Push the Action button for more than 1 but less than 1 8 seconds how dumb is that With only 4 buttons there are too many button sequence combos to remember Seriously a volume up down AND a track up down would have made life so much easier All in all this is a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker with some good features let down with a dumb user interface If you don t mind learning a few tricks to use this device it will be great However if you are one of those people who doesn t read instructions get something that is more intuitive to use If you re in need of a new lightweight portable speaker that s compatible with iOS and Android this is the one for you I was stoked to try a speaker from Beats with a great battery life and increased output however not having any stereo image from a speaker this wide is just silly I m sorry I ll stick with the Wonderboom or Everboom Wish they d make a Wonderboom with USB C but the stereo imaging on it even with slightly less bass and output than the Beats Pill is where it s still at for me I love a good stereo image too much to keep a mono product sorry The media could not be loaded For a smallish portable sized speaker this sounds great Works well with my iPhone and sounds high quality and clear with music which is what it s for The bass on this speaker is awesome so if that s something you enjoy you ll enjoy this And of course the iconic design still looks fun and unique It also came with stickers a cable and instructions a bonus I accidentally got two of the packet things but I m not complaining at all haha The media could not be loaded Great audio loud and just looks rlly good Had great hopes for this speaker but unfortunately it switches off randomly even when fully charged Sometimes this happens in less than 30 min which is a big problem because it s battery life is supposed to be much longer than that It s beautifully made and looks elegant like Beats products do but unfortunately it just does not work like it s supposed to I will update this review if needed based on further experience Simple to use very simple to pair within the Apple ecosystem supporting iCloud pairing and simple initial pair Can easily get battery information directly from device AirPlay integration would have been welcome Controls are simple although take some practice to get used to Power button controls both power and pairing I do wish the Pill could be turned on with one touch of power button I ve yet to test the microphone speaker function but that s a nice enough addition I find the sound great but I am no audiophile I intend to use this speaker for what portable speakers are best designed for travel beach patio etc It sounds excellent even at moderate volume The dual pairing function looks awesome although not within my use case Design is sleek and feels solid but light enough for great portability The soft touch silicone feels great although I can foresee being a bit of a dirt magnet at least on the champagne gold model The lanyard is a welcome addition but I do wish it was adjustable unsure what the point of adding a lanyard is if it cannot be tightened loosened USB C is a great addition as is fast fuel Battery life is rated at 24H Based on early usage I would believe this to be reasonably accurate Unit drained about 10 listening to podcasts at 50 volume Overall positive first impression Definitely not a cheap speaker but you are buying this for the ecosystem integration good sound and excellent battery life Price is pretty on par with similar quality speakers Beats products are frequently discounted so maybe wait for a sale Upgraded from an Anker Soundcore 2 Considered JBL and Bose but went with the new Beats Pill due to battery quick charge and its integration with iPhone Also really like the look of the speaker in the champagne colour It s compact and efficient with the lithium battery and usb C charger integrated it doesn t take much time to be fully charged Good quality sound for the price ranged Feels so solid of a device highly recommend it Only thing I am not happy about is it does not connect to HomePods The Goods As a Master s student looking for the perfect wireless speaker s for my monitor setup I was thrilled by how good the new Beats Pill sounds With a punchy bass and a wide sound stage even for classical film music I ve enjoyed using them yes I got a pair for music and watching Netflix The sound quality from stereo pair is absolutely amazing I love that it is type C fast charge and that battery lasts for at least 2 days of normal use the feature to reverse charge ur other devices is certainly nice but a bit gimmicky in my opinion considering I ve never found a scenario to do so It supports airplay and findmy and I could control it from my Mac Macbook iPhone iPad and my Apple Watch A nice convenience feature The Bad A price tag of 199 CAD 2x HomePod mini is just not affordable to most especially for a pair 398 The shape of the pill the rather hefty weight makes it harder to grab Sometimes I d get the spinny wheel on Airplay for the longest time without connecting to the Pill I could not connect to the app for stereo pair at all The app never found my Pills You must hold down your fingers on two Pills concurrently to enter stereo mode not v user friendly With power button serving many functions I had to learn how many seconds it takes to turn on off enter pairing mode etc The soft rubber surface on top and around the Pill s back attract all kinds of micro dusts and lint Verdict While the New Beats Pill delivers incredible sound quality compatibility and performance it is NOT designed with user friendly interactions in mind The many little inconveniences will eventually add up to the point you realize it is probably not worth it for its hefty price tag Alternative The Bose SoundFlex offers virtually the same features except for Airplay compatibility it is more affordable has a functional in app pairing control experience has an extra speaker grill in its back and pairs to 2 devices simultaneously while supporting automatic pause play as you switch between devices\n"
